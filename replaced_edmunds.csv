i usually find the german car are more generous with head room; i drove a new ""man"" volkswagen with plenty headroom...same with the older volkswagen/volkswagen.

yup, austin, one of the options i wish i had was the cooled seat (i recall the cts having great ones). nothing worse than having your forehead frozen (not enough head room for the air to circulate) and your back sweaty in the tx heat (friday parking lot temp...109).

i'm familiar with both columbia and hidy. funny that hidy was trying to sell a car that was on columbia's lot.

interesting about carwoo, also. personally, i don't care if dealers know my identity. but, i can see where if you didn't want to be bothered with having them contact you where it might be useful.

anyway, that tl is a very nice ride. you'll like it during the time you have it parked in your driveway.

funny about audis. when i was looking several months ago, s4s were on my shopping list. the cincinnati dealer told me they had such limited stock of everything because the factory wasn't shipping them as many car. that included their volume model the audi. they had one s4, but it wasn't even close to what i was looking for, and it was a demo.

the audi store in dayton had one, but it was a 2k mi trade-in (wonder how much of a bath that owner took) who wanted the (then new) audi instead.

beechmont had the best selection with 4 s4s at the time. but, like you, i couldn't see where the price delta was worth it to pay that much more over the similar tl sh awd.

bmw is offering to do a factory performance retrofit on my bmw, which would up both the hp and the torque by about 7%. understand, i believe that bmw is stretching the truth about how much hp and torque the bmw motor is putting out in factory trim (it's a lot more). the kicker, i can do the facotry performance upgrade at my dealership, complete with normal bmw warranty for $600. 

i'm debating if i'll want it. my car's already as fast as greased lightening, how much more could i want? but, we're talking 20 extra ponies here."

acura was successful for a long time with the acura and acura. then it was the acura and tl. and now it is the fat acura and fat tl and useless rl. the fuel economy regulations are getting tougher and tougher. bmw is going 4 cyl in the us on smaller car. bmw and infiniti sell a lot of car based upon sporty handling, which is something that acura has lost much of in the acura. adding a fuel hogging 6 cyl, then throwing 200 lbs. of awd for the *entire market* seems like the wrong direction to me for an ellps.

bigger problem than tires..... got the car back yesterday afternoon. in a quick 15 minutes close eyeball inspection, i was able to find at least 10 things wrong with the car.
a small scuff/scratch on the black plastic windshield cowl, multiple black marks/paint blemishes on bumper edges/corners, a small minor white scratch that if not on the prior existing damage sheet, must of been caused during the shop's 38 day ownership of the car, a tiny chip on the roof, some rough slightly bumpy paint around edges such as around the fuel filling cap area, the underside of the hood has a paint blemish, and a general impression that orange peel is more prevalent or noticeable, but not bad, just not great.
i was expecting all that above and i'm sure most of that can be fixed in a 2nd trip to the body shop under warranty. however, i wasn't expecting the following:
misaligned right doors (or at least the trim isn't lining up right) haven't measured but i'd say around 3/16"" if i had to guess).
lower rocker panel fit and finish issues (increased gap, noticeable double sided sticky tape seeping through the wide uneven gap, paint blemishes at joint) they admitted that even with a brand new rocker panel, 9 new rivets, audi's instructions, and new double-sided sticky tape, they've never been able to match what they do in germany. they suggest it must be installed differently in the factory. looks aftermarket now.
the exhaust was removed and reinstalled, and now both sets of exhaust tips appear to be hanging too low in relation to the back bumper diffuser, with the right two exhaust tips noticeably about 1/2""-3/4"" lower than the left pair of exhaust tips. 
number 3 bothers me the most. they say if what you can see is bad and lacks qc, then perhaps what you can't see is even worse. oh yeah, and there's still about a 4"" piece of masking tape on the lower edge of the front right door (detailer should be fired).
on the other hand, the mechanical work seems solid; that's the bright side. the car drives and runs well (of course the dealership did a large portion of that work). i'd say the only thing i can tell that might be a tad ever so slightly off is the steering wheel might just be like 1 degree off-center; very close. when i eyeball leveling the steering wheel, the car will move slightly right, then again, maybe my eyeballs are off by a degree or two.

andres....just my personal opinion, but i think it's time to go to the insurance company and tell them you need a new car....for all the reasons listed. if they choose to fight (like with the tires, which to me is being rather nit-picky given all 4 tires should have the same tread depth), then you can tell them to give you a new car now, or risk having a car with a salvage title instead after you begin your proceedings."

i think you'd enjoy four-wheel driving even more than steering. did you consider or test drive the tlx with sh-awd? i know you probably wouldn't like the fuel economy penalty, but a test drive wouldn't hurt to give consideration for the fun factor. although, i'd imagine the 4-banger might be overtapped with awd. 
a 4-cylinder is really enough power for me. i didn't test drive the v-6 because i knew that wasn't in the cards—and not really suited for my budget and driving style. this particular 2018 tlx tech 2.4 4ws had more than $6k of lease incentives. i did have a trade-in, but my monthly lease payment including taxes and everything else is $229 for a car that has an msrp of $37,600. that's the right level for our budget, esp. since my wife's payment on her 3-year car loan is $450—and we have a daughter starting college in a year.

but the 4-wheel steering on the tlx is enjoyable. i worry now that i won't want a car without this feature in the future. but given that acuras with good maintenance and some luck tend to last a long time, this is a car that may—knock on wood—be with me for a while."
0,0,"smarty 666,

my point was that infiniti made several repairs to our vehicles after the warranty expired and well after any mandate required them to do.

acura did not. their refusal to equitably share in the repairs of the transmission occurred after we presented, in wiriting and in great detail, our documented complaints over 5 years on this transmission.

this is my experience. yours may be different. it seems we are both ""car guys"" with differing experiences who can engage in lively discussions but with different opinions.

acura is clearly having sales problem with their tl. that is not in dispute. hopefully these discussion are read by them and they can return acura to their prior level of quality and desirability. hopefully acura, infiniti, bmw, et al read these posts and attempt to improve their transmissions, brakes, engines etc and provide better and safer car for their customers.

#2: 7-speed dual clutch automatic (""auto-manual"")
#3: 8-speed steptronic (torque converter ""slush box"")

even the suggestion that an 8-speed steptronic is better than a 6-speed is a little questionable. i recall when bmw responded to lexus introduction of 8-speed autos with the counter that bmw engine torque bands were wide enough that they didn't want to add more gears to have the car fishing for the right one at a particular speed. is the current 8-speed steptronic a response to the epa in trying to eek an extra mpg out of the engine? just like the not so popular start stop feature. the 6-speed auto in our x5d has no trouble producing 30 mpg on the highway and accelerating like a (big) v8 from 50 to 80. i can see where the lower torque 3.5i might benefit with 2 extra gears, but the x5d doesn't need them. 

what's next, a 10-speed auto that has to shift 9 times to get you to a highway cruise? or worse, a cvt transmission with an ""infinite"" number of equivalent gear ratios? at least when porsche made their epa concession, it was by adding a 7th gear to their manual that was a pure overdrive. they left the first 6 ratios untouched. the engine redlines in 6th gear at 188 mph (top speed) and the ratios are perfectly matched to get every ounce of performance out of the engine. that's what's important. and should be to bmw. not playing a who's got more game with lexus."

well, i got my first chance to drive one for an extensive period of time. it was a rental (enterprise). it was the 6 cyl model with what looked like the middle of the options package (everything but nav).

first, it's a big car.

it drove fine....actually, it drove pretty good. i was in milwaukee (oshkosh) wi with it when it snowed for the first time this fall. it handled the snow and slush just fine. 

the suspension that everyone bitched about isn't bad...at least not as bad as i had read about here at edmunds. yes, there are some road surfaces that cause an unrefined chassis feeling, but for the most part, it was fine....similar to a mercedes-benz benz e, without the unrefined part. 

there were some things where hitting their price point caused some short cuts. if that's real wood in the cabin, the trees they used must have been very sick. the seat are....well....they're wide....certainly not very comfortable (and on the opposite end of the seat you'd find in the tl sh awd or my bmw....both are great). the lighting is superb in the cabin.

they spend the money on the drivetrain, you can tell. the engine is responsive and sounds uber refined. the transmission shifts seamlessly and is ready to kick down when needed.

all the switches feel richer than they should, and operate with a smoothness that was unexpected.

all-in-all a nice first effort. came close to mimicking the audi, mercedes-benz benz e, lexus ls, (not really in the same category as a bmw 5 from both a dynamic and performance category). not quite hit the nail on the head, but relatively close for a lot less money."

you may find yourself still needing the help of a mechanic after you got the tools and electronic gadget. while it's good to read up and learn the work that might be needed on your car, so you won't get ripped, it's better to let the mechanic do the job because he has more experience than you on the brand (as your post seemed to convey).

in my younger days i often thought why can't such mechanically superior european car be available to everyone to appreciate? now i see the reason -- repairs and maintenance. the car makers have made their car affordable to many, but the r & m cost is a reason why some people would take the lease and dump the car when done.

it would be wise to shop for a garage that service your bmw. my car maintained at dealership because the garage guys i used aren't cheaper and not better either. don't take recommendations for granted, and always price out at dealers and garage both for every job and read the forums for advice. dealers won't say ""let's try this and see"", but some garage does, and that could be their ways to milk you out of thousands per try until nothing gets done and you wised up.

honda has been well known for that since the 1980's. honda is well committed to the minimal trim lines within a model and then options are dealer installed model. it seems to work for them just fine and in reality, i find that most people would rather have that than a dizzying array of options to choose from. further, it makes driving it home today much easier.
it works for them because the buying public allows it to happen. what would happen if honda's sales would drop say, 13% a year and market research shows that people want to be able to order their car? would honda change?

that said, i keep meticulous records on my 3. i have every fill-up recorded. i'm averaging about 22 mpg, overall. lowest i got was 19 mpg. highest was 29 mpg. lowest price for gas i paid over the last year was $3.19/gal, highest was $4.01/gal. that's almost a 30% swing....with no supply disruption, with worldwide demand either flat, or declining. tell me that traders aren't manipulating prices.

japan vs german.....well, i think my former tl was built as well as anything i ever owned from germany (essentially, 3 bmw). that said, the cts coupe i test drove was as solid as anything i've ever driven.

i had heard that the audis were oil hogs, from more than one person. but, sounds like they may have a ""fix"" in the works for that.

my 2nd choice over my bmw coupe was either an s4 or an audi. at least locally, none of the ones they had in stock appealed to me. the two local dealers had all of 2 s4s in stock, and acted like they were made of platinum, or convertible a5s (again, i wanted a coupe).

so, neither got into my check book."
0,0,"i never saw new nissan in person. nissan evidently does not want to participate in autoshows. last one in san jose for some reason had infinitis on display, but not nissan. i saw nissan on the road though and it has presence while g looks kind of cartoonish and funny with strange proportions. anyway infinity g is spacious inside at least for me, but it is like compact car in back and has smallish trunk - but it has rwd after all. so it is not efficient as a family car. 

well what i actually wanted to say that i went to nissan website and took a look. agree - interior does not look like luxury car but is pleasant enough. the point i want to make is that i compared it with closest competitors - buick buick and lincoln lincoln - all they are similar in every dimensions and purpose. it does not look like competitor to toyota or ford which are larger car.

then i went to truecar.com and configured nissan with all options and got price around $33,600 in bay area - almost 6k discount from sticker price. similarly equipped entry level luxury car, like audi, lincoln, infiniti cost around 36k-37k according to truecar.com. buick is priced similar to nissan with 2.0t turbo engine. btw audi has engine similar to buick and lincoln as engine similar to nissan, but better interior quality. and i guess buick is to audi (both are german car) same as nissan to g. with exception that it has better exterior design and higher quality interior than nissan. i would certainly test drive and compare buick to nissan, buick may prove to be more sporty car after all (though opel never had this kind reputation) and it is certainly more elegant. if you do not like g - cts is most logical choice - it cost same 36k options but with 3.0l engine. true there is infiniti dodge - but it is decontented car, it costs less. bmw is even smaller car than g and lexus is is smaller yet.

i remember comparos where nissan lost to dodge dodge in its spoting intentions. nissan after all is a large fwd car. i drove previous nissan - it was smaller but no more sporty than base ford. i do not know from where sport-sedan notion comes from when people talk about nissan. people use sport-sedan notion too often. i heard even hyundai called sport sedan which is absolutely ridiculous."

not if moving forward with the same platform. the sheetmetal bolted to it isn't shared between the vehicles, so it doesn't matter if one gets redesigned unless it is moving to a new platform.

however, in this case, you are incorrect anyway, as the g is on the fm platform (rwd/awd), while the nissan is on the d platform.

granted, the 7er is most certainly not an ellps, but a key quote from the story provides a bit of hope:

there’s less steering feedback than we prefer, but in every other sense this light and lively 7 appears as if it may vault bmw back to its glory days as the world leader in driving dynamics.

unfortunately, it seems that when one refers to the steering of a current bmw as being ""dumbed-down,"" the characterization is-sadly-literally quite accurate:

...tuning the electric assist to provide more[feedback] is not that much of a challenge. unfortunately, luxury buyers whine when too much sense of the road tickles their fingers, so bmw engineers are forced into numb steering by customer demand."

every time a comparison is done, same complaints come up for the infinitis....too much nvh from the engine, disconnected steering, non linear braking, poor clutch engagement...and what do they do every year? up the horsepower....go figure.

http://www.stoptech.com/technical-support/technical-white-papers/-warped-brake-d- isc-and-other-myths

""every case of ""warped brake disc"" that i have investigated, whether on a racing car or a street car, has turned out to be friction pad material transferred unevenly to the surface of the disc. this uneven deposition results in thickness variation (tv) or run-out due to hot spotting that occurred at elevated temperatures."""
0,0,"regarding the statements: "" bmw probably does the most to subsidize their leases. i think mercedes-benz benz does, too."" and: ""i wouldn't call it subsidizes they have programs...""
well, the truth of the matter is that bmw [among others] does provide ""financial support"" for leases made through their financial companies. this support is often (usually) called a ""sub-vented lease.""
subventing makes leasing more attractive to the buyer who doesn't care so much about the msrp of a given vehicle, but does care about the monthly payment. either a purchase or a lease ""deal"" can be subvented -- but the real impact of subventing is going to be able to be much greater for a lease than a loan.
the best thing that can be done regarding a loan to buy a new car is that the interest rate charged can be set to zero (0% apr). this way a $36,000 car can be purchased and the payments determined by dividing $36,000 by the number of months that payments will be made. $36,000 divided by 36 months, then, equals doh! a $1,000 per month payment.
i assume we could stretch the point and say that the manufacturer could offer a ""loyalty"" or ""conquest"" or even a ""just because"" bonus or rebate or discount of $1,000, making the amount financed be only $35,000, meaning the payment would be $35,000 divided by 36 months or $972.22/month.
a subvented lease, on the other hand, is where the mfg can really influence your ""purchase"" decision. here's why.
when you lease a new car, the payment will be determined (generally speaking) by several things:
1.the % of value (residual value) that the car will have at the end of the lease
2.the money factor (think of it as the interest rate) that is used.
roughly speaking you can calculate the lease payment (remember the word ""roughly"") by subtracting the residual value from the msrp of the car to get your anticipated usage cost.
if the car is $36,000 and its residual is 50%, your usage over 36 months is $18,000. if you put money (out of your pocket) as what you might term a ""down payment"" you will reduce the amount of the ""agreement"" by that amount (this is called a capitalized cost reduction).
this ""down payment"" [in your mind] does not reduce the residual value of the car, meaning that if you decided to buy the car at the end of the lease the amount you will have to come up with will still be $18,000. please, don't call any money down on a conventional (closed-end) lease a down payment and i won't either. it is a ""cap cost reduction"" -- and the purpose of this cap cost reduction is solely to reduce the monthly payment. you are not building up any value, post lease, whatsoever.
the money factor (or the implied cost of money -- or interest rate) is applied to recognize the value of the ""time"" you have the auto mfg's finance arm's money tied up.
far more detailed explanations -- and explanations that are specific to your lease deal -- are available here on edmunds and of course at your dealership.
the bottom line, however, is this: the auto manufacturer's financial outlet may offer a lease to you that has been subvented by the manufacturer. the subventing can take the form of:
a reduction of the money factor -- including taking it to zero; or,
an increase of the residual % -- including taking it to a very optimistic % (+5% or even more) -- meaning the car will be said to be worth a much larger percentage of its brand new value than market conditions would likely support.
this manipulation of the residual cannot be done when the car is financed outright -- so perhaps you can see that a subvented lease could produce a very very low monthly payment if the mfg decides to reduce the money factor to zero or near zero and increases the residual value significantly over the expected depreciation.
subvented leases often carry with them terms that are not as ""friendly"" to you as a straight buy with a loan or a lease that has not been subvented.
if the manufacturer says the residual is 62% after 36 months and the reality of the situation is that the 36 month value should only be 55%, you may not be able to get out of your lease early without a huge $ penalty (plus perhaps a standalone early termination fee or penalty).
if you buy and finance a car, you can sell or trade you car almost at any time and only pay the potential difference between the outstanding loan amount and the amount you can sell the car for. it may feel like a prepayment penalty, but the reality is that there will be no literal prepayment penalty (it is uncommon for an auto loan from a bank, for instance, to have a prepayment penalty -- if you want to get out of the loan, you can sell the car and give the proceeds to the bank plus a bit more out of your pocket or perhaps a check from the bank.)
so, leases give, leases take. leases are sometimes of the very, very low payment variety -- meaning there is some subventing going on and suggesting that you'd better be prepared to not fall out of love with your new baby for ""about 90%"" of the lease's term. i say that because it is also common practice to put customers in 39 month leases and then around month 33 start to seduce ""owners"" into the showrooms with the promise of letting them out of their leases without penalties if they re-lease the new model.
bmw does have a reputation -- i assume well founded -- for ""supporting"" (subventing) leases. this can make getting into a $50,000 bimmer ""within reach."" it also pretty much locks customers into the cycle of ""lease, burn through the lease, and re-lease"" again and again.
nothing wrong with that for a lot of consumers. but not for all.
if you want to keep your car 5 years or longer, you may not find leasing economics works for you;
if you drive more than 18,000 miles per year (and probably the message could be ""more than 15,000 miles per year), you may not find leasing economics works for you (as your residual will likely drop sharply, meaning the monthly payment will rise sharply in response);
if you own a business, on the other hand, leasing may mean you can ""expense your lease payment"" to the company (with proper and available proof), which many would consider to be a good thing;
if you want to build equity in your car, well that is ""highly"" (or at least ""fairly"") unlikely in a leased car, but more likely in a car that you are making payments on to buy.
and the pros of leasing and buying go on.
neither my wife nor i had ever purchased a car, until late 2013 when we bought her '14 audi sq5 prestige; we also lease a '14 audi s4 (and are fully intending, 4 months into the lease, to buy the thing at the end of the lease -- and we put no money down on the lease). this is a new experience for us and we keep rationalizing that -- at this time -- buying (for us) will likely turn out to be a better deal since we intend on keeping the car more than 5 years.
so, my point in all that is above is this: auto manufacturers do indeed provide financial subsidies (i.e., named subvented lease programs). multiple security deposits are not, strictly speaking, subsidies, however.

do the manufacturers read our rants and raves?

the short answer is no. the long answer is no. they don't care. as long as the sales are going up, they think everything is better than ever.
regarding your dealer appearing disinterested in fixing your car, one possible explanation is that the manufacturer pays them just enough to break even on simple clear-cut issue (remove x, put new part back), but they may not get enough money to pay for diagnostic effort required when complex systems are involved. then there may be manufacturers policy of putting head into sand when it comes to some issues, like mmi and such. if it's not direct safety (where they may get a big slap from media and/or government), they get less incentive to actually make it work. moreover, complex electronic infotainment systems have a standing ""beta version"" stance. my observation is anytime software is involved, the sellers have some kind of indemnity - all those lengthy and unfair terms of use basically allow them to charge full price for a developmental product. so it goes like that: what da ya want - it's new, complex, it's gremlins, i dunno notin'."

before i give my impressions of the volvo there a couple things you need to know. i was coming out of a 2005 toyota limited, which was a great car. this is a loaded 2013 and is my first ""luxury/near luxury car."" the front seat toyota for both the passenger and driver are outstanding. all of the controls are on the steering wheel or within easy reach. handling is outstanding, power and acceleration are very good (this is my first turbo). visibility is very good. the car has a solid feel. no rattles. the ride is a little choppy on rough roads, very good otherwise. i'm getting 30+ on the highway at about 65 mph and around 24 in mixed driving on regular.

the phone, radio, nav, etc. are accessed through the volvo sensus system, which works fine once you get past the learning curve. our cell phones, itouch work fine. the sensus/nav screen is not a touch screen. it's 7 inches. i wish it was a little larger. the tach. and speedometer are not backlit. the interior has that orderly understated look, but, not surprisingly, lacks ""bling"". sensus is voice activated and works very well.

i got all of the safety features, all of which seem to work as advertised. two of the best are adaptive cruise control and active bending xenon headlights. i find lane departure annoying, so i've shut it off. i don't let any of these ""safety nannies"" drive the car for me, but if they can give me a heads up, i'll take it.

on the downside are a tight back seat and no spare. there is an inflation kit in the trunk. this was almost a deal breaker for me. the dealer threw in a donut spare, which comes in a fabric zip bag and is strapped down in the trunk, a + $200 option. this makes a smallish trunk even smaller.

volvo offers the safe and secure plan, which covers maintenance and repairs (even brakes) for 5 yrs. or 50,000 miles. (tires are not covered under this plan.)

the car is very fun to drive and i'm happy with it. hope this helps."

0,0,"this review of 26,000 miles of ownership in a tesla model 3 says that compared to a similar gas car he's saved about $2000 by using electricity instead of gasoline. but the telsa model 3 with a few options is, as he says, a $50,000 car on which you can't get any discounts. because of big discounts and lease incentives i paid close to $30,000 for my more luxurious tlx. with that $20,000 difference there's no way even at 2k in fuel savings a year that you'll come out ahead. and i don't drive 26k miles a year, but more like 14k. and so the fuel savings would maybe be more like $1200. plus my guess is that by the time he gets to 100,000 miles, if he keeps the model 3 that long, he might need to replace the batteries, which might be a c. $10,000 repair, while with maintenance and good luck the engine and transmission on a tlx might go past 200k without major repairs. the tlx has environmental costs, but so does getting rid of or trying to recycle a huge number of tesla batteries. the bottom line is that the costs for long-term ownership still favors the tlx big a big margin as far as i can see. i see the appeal, but the math just doesn't seem to add up unless you are so well off that costs aren't really a significant factor....



ps finally, the expensive extended range version of the model 3 will go about 300 miles before it needs a recharge, while the tlx 2.4 can go twice that on the highway."

don't get me wrong. i like bmw. but, when a 335ix tipped the $60k+ scale equipped the way i like, and the 235i came in close behind, i could see that the threshold had been exceeded.

there are a lot of really good car (as good or better than bmw) at price points that are much less.
my sentiments exactly; i've owned 10 bmw-from an e24 bmw to an e83 truck-over the past 32 years and i completely agree that upwards of 99% of the new bimmers don't offer nearly enough performance to justify their premium price- particularly when you have to pay for ""options"" that come standard on many much less expensive car(see: hids, enhanced bluetooth and usb connectivity, decent ice, ehp summer tires, heated seat, etc., etc.)."

if you follow the trend, the sh awd version will have a 9 speed trans and a 3.5l v6. guessing that it will put out something in the 310-325 hp range.

great story gg. i can't wait to hear the rest. by the way, that is a beautiful car. i hope you print your story on sales frontlines too.

briefly, we were going to trade in my wife's 2008 335xi bmw for a 2013 328 or 335ix. we went on saturday to test them. i checked the value of our trade in before i left and i got a range of $20,100 for dented one, and $24800 for top condition. appraiser gave a value of $20000, said that is what they pay for them at the ""bmw auctions"".

btw, the car is in mint condition, new tires, alignment, and 38k miles!

we left, i told the salesman his price was good, he would take 5.5% off the new one. the difference was $42k for the 335 and $36k for a 328.
my wife really wants a garage door opener on the mirror, and to get that on a 335 you need to take the navi-camera option which costs $4500. on a 328 you need 2 options, $1500+$4500. she doesn't need those.
before we left i said i would pay $40k difference, for the 335. he said it won't work.

we left, i told the salesman, who is excellent, his price on the new one is good, but i am not too pleased with the allowance on the trade in, and i hinted the bmw auction sounds like an excuse to give you a low price.

we checked out an audi dealer on the way home, mainly because i was curious to see how much they would give me for our trade in. the salesman had a standard 2011 audi coupe to try (or was it an audi?), and we loved it. then we tried a 4 door 2013 premium plus automatic sedan, just to make sure the car felt right.

0,0,"a sub-vented lease can be a better deal than buying for many folks.

years back, jaguars leased for stupid numbers (very very low per month) -- the car were discounted, but not enough to justify not leasing. the odd thing is the leases were closed ended which meant there was no risk for the person who leased with respect to residual value.

here's how they did it (or at least how it was done by some mfgrs):

the lease price of the car is the cost of the use of the car for x months (lets say 24 or 36). to determine the lease, the financial arm went ahead and jacked up the residual value of the car to something impossible let's say 70% of msrp. then they took the 30% of msrp and divided it by 36 or whatever to come up with a crazy, artificially low (sub-vented) lease price per month. in some cases what they did was purchase an insurance policy to guarantee the 70% or at least some part of the 70%. then they made the lease have a get out early penalty that pretty much meant you had little choice but to keep the car the full 36 months or you would pay through the nose. in some cases you actually had to keep the car -- you could not simply make the remaining payments to get off the hook.

yet, for those that wanted an $80,000 (pick a car) for $399 per month with no money down, there was simply no way a purchase made any sense.

now, infiniti certainly does sub-vent, but not crazy crazy like the above mostly true example. the payment for the use of the car is indeed artificially low, but remember you are paying for the sub-vented cost of use of the car (which is less than you would pay had you purchased the car up front).

then at the conclusion of the lease there is maybe the possibility of getting the car for its real, honest, market value -- not the bloated, made up residual. if the car is good and you can get it at real true market value in month 25 or 37 or whatever, you actually did get a good deal since all you paid for was the rental amount for the past 24 months anyway and it was, er, ""rent controlled.""

infiniti's can be a bargain when they are helped along via the finance arm via a sub-venting process. as far as acura's are concerned, their financial arm hasn't always been a flexible in that regard -- but perhaps it is because they didn't need to with the acura being the lion's share of their business.

it seems to me the tlx (and i come from a tl and actually liked it) was/is a missed opportunity to de-honda-ize the brand. at this point, however nice they are, they are, underneath, prime honda. that is not a bad thing, but the thing that i always thought about infiniti was that they really did attempt to build a car that could rival a bmw. acuras are still sold as fwd vehicles (a big mistake if you axe me), the infiniti in question here is, actually, really and truly, a rear wheel drive vehicle that can be had with awd (very bmw-ish, there).

moreover, don't go thinking lexi are much more of an engineering tour de force vis a vis toyota as acuras are compared to honda.

but, so it seems, the market has spoken and the infiniti car are not the leaders of the pack, more like the laggards of the pack -- hence super-sub-venting to the rescue which may move more of them off the lots until a new and improved version can be screwed together for your inspection.

we bought our first car last year a $65,000+ audi sq5 -- we put $22,000 down, have a 2.25% apr note on it and it is now showing at being worth about $48k. we still owe $33k on it. we've lost, in my estimation, $7k -- had the thing been offered with a sub-venting finance package on a lease, well, that would have been a no-brainer. we're hoping the plummeting cash value of the car will, in year two, hit the brakes and that maybe we'll have a point in time where the car ""feels"" like it was a better decision to buy than to lease.

we'll see how it goes. 

meantime who cares what the car's msrp is? not most americans. they, er, we, only really care about the monthly payment. 

when a $50k+ car can be had for $399 per month for the life of its warranty and then simply dropped off with no muss, no fuss, well that hardly seems like a bad thing. speaking of sub-venting, cadillac is doing the same thing with their cts and ats and cadillac vehicles as we speak."

0,0,"why pay $5,300 more for a car that has a heavier front end, takes more gasoline to propel it and has 15 ft lbs less torque -- and that the torque it does have comes on at thousands of rpm's higher?

i had an allroad 2.7t and i had also had three audi car with the 4.2 v8 (one audi and two audi's) -- so when it came time to order the allroad, i test drove another sort of similar car, an audi 2.7t. 

torque rules.

and in the example above, the v8 had 295 ft pounds of torque vs the v6's 258 ft pounds, yet the v6 was quicker because the torque came on (in the v6) at below 2,000 rpms and the v8 didn't come up to full boil until north of 3500 rpms.

in this case, the new 2.0tfsi has 258 ft pounds, below 2000 rpms and the 3.2fsi has 243 at north of 3200 rpms -- this is a no brainer.

the v6 imho is for the consumer who wants to talk about the 265hp v6 (despite its lower torque.)

had audi offered the engine competing with the bmw 335 i6 turbo, well, that might have been a horse(power) of a different color.

i believe the audi 2.0t will be the car of choice for about 10-12 months in the audi family; the v6 being offered solely for marketing reasons (""wouldn't do,"" to have this car without a v6 in the brochure, kind of thing.)

i may, but i doubt it, regret this decision. but the handling, mileage and performance of the 2.0tfsi should be superior in cincinnati oh (where it will see most of its duty.) it will easily top any speed limit we have in these parts (just as easily as the v6) and its quickness, for a while at least, will be unequaled -- at least until the supercharged v6 comes out in a year or so.

another audi 3.2 certainly was an option -- but the new audi will have a 110+"" wheel base, the audi is 111+"" -- the balance, rwd biased audi, sport package and other amenities and luxuries in the premium plus package makes the audi 2.0tfsi a ""better"" choice for someone who wants cts style luxury (at least) and very bmw like performance and handling -- in a handsome package.

rationalization?

perhaps -- but there are just too many head to head (audi vs audi) test reports and reviews of this new audi to make me wonder ""who in their right mind would pay more for less?"" -- and that seems to make the case in favor of the audi (b8) 2.0t with ""all the option boxes ticked off -- except acc.""

so, we'll see how much under $50k this comes out to be -- and hopefully i will not regret not going with my second choice: the new infiniti g37x 4 door sedan.

fwiw, my dealer says this car should be comparable in msrp to the outgoing model + about $2,000 for the audi drive select and a ""few hundred"" more for the addition of a backup camera.

thus: a 320 ""invites"" all ""3"" class car along with it. 

i do not have access to ""unlimited"" funds (as a practical matter, few of us do, even the 2%-ers) -- but my search and the folks i know and ""fraternize"" with (middle and upper-middle class earners) typically buy/lease within a 2 class range. example: my neighbor says he's looking at bmw. i say ""what model?"" he says, ""probably a 5 series, the 3 is too small, maybe a 7 series, i'll have to see what kind of deal i can get.""

one day, i see what i presume is a new 535ix with dealer plates in his driveway. as i pass, i roll down my window and stop to ask, ""is that the new ride?"" he says, ""they gave it to me for the weekend, i have to take it back monday, i dunno."" i say, ""you'll really appreciate the x-drive if we have another winter like this one.""

he says, ""no poop?!?"" (not really).

next time i drive by -- a few days later, i see a new 7 series in the driveway with temp tags on it. when i see him next, i ask him about it. he tells me, ""the lease payment on this car wasn't much more than the payment on the 5 and this thing is loaded -- i couldn't turn it down.""

now, for all i know he was set on a 7 series all along -- he is a tall drink of water. but i think he was assuming the 5 series would be fine and fit the financial parms he and his wife had set. well, when for a ""little more"" he could have a 7 series, well it was probably not an agonizing decision. 

the thing that cracks me up is what ""always"" happens (and if you don't believe me, spend some time on audiworld's forums): the new fill-in-the-blank is acquired (purchased, financed or leased) and about 15 minutes later, the proud new owner is browsing tire rack, apr, (fill in the blank for your brand of lps car) etc for ""all the stuff"" that this brand new owner will buy to modify his (or her) new ride.

i have seen -- again, over on audi world -- folks announce the new audi they've just ordered, then announce that the car is at the dealer, then post picture of the new car (while it is still at the dealership) with the title of the post ""let the mods begin."" 

folks (broad generalization) buy/lease any of these car that can genuinely and without qualification be in the ""something"" lps class and then dump another dump-truck of money on aftermarket tires and wheels, engine management chips, pullies, exhaust systems, brakes, lights, spoilers, coil-overs, audio systems, nav systems, headlights, tail-lights, interior treatments, and . . . (the list goes on and on and on -- thank you sema).

it seems to me if you have ""graduated"" to the luxury performance sedan (etc), that you can, practically speaking, pretty much afford anything you damn well please. 

the wheels and tires alone ""y'all"" spring for on an otherwise very well equipped 335 or infiniti or s4 cost a young fortune -- yet ""y'all"" go ahead and plunk down the forty-nine, eleventy-twelve thousand dollars on the car and then just for grins put on a $2,400 set of rims with $1,200 worth of rubber on them without batting a freakin' eye. 

what really cracks me up is the folks who acquire an audi and then spend thousands on engine, suspension and tire and wheel mods so that they can create what they designate as an as4 -- when for another $50 a month they could've had an s4 and be done with it (and the warranty would still be in full force, too).

one audi buyer purchased one without navigation and then worked and worked until he found all of the parts required to retro-fit the audi oem nav system into the thing -- talk about costing a fortune. i often wonder, why not buy an audi and see how much money and sweat it will take to fit the dsg transmission in place of the 8-speed tiptronic.

it ain't the money that compels ""our"" actions in this class of car -- at least as far as the fan site participants are concerned. some of the aftermarket audio systems, too, cost more than a new 4k 79"" uhdtv.

0,0,"i agree with the comments about the beauty of the new infiniti. i think it is very handsome on the outside and both inside and out it seems more upscale befitting its inclusion with its competition from audi, bmw, cadillac, lexus & mercedes-benz benz to name a few.
the issues with the infiniti seem not to be with its comeliness, rather with its steering feel or lack thereof. other critiques seem to remind the reader that the 3.7l normally aspirated engine -- while somewhat more sound isolated in the infiniti -- is ""coarse"" and that the 7-speed transmission is a carryover.
now, having just turned in our 2011 infiniti after 60,000 miles, i would say even if there were no improvements in the transmission in the infiniti, that it is a fine transmission. likewise, the 3.7l engine is powerful even if not particularly blessed with an abundance of torque. after driving the new infiniti, the ""thrash"" and coarseness often attributed to this engine has been muted significantly, but, this mill isn't up to the smoothness of the german 6-cylinder engines and one wonders why infiniti hasn't noticed (apparently) that forced induction engines are the currently favored configuration.
overall, the infiniti (at least this first toyota out with the new infiniti) seems unlikely to be finishing as the top choice against its german and japanese competitors. i assume infiniti was shooting to be the darling of the ellps set, but came up short compared to the lexus is 350 [f sport, especially].
from a styling perspective, i find the infiniti to be handsome; it looks expensive. the is 350 is, well, ""edgy"" with its audacious styling and spindle grill. the is looks like it would be sporty (to me, at least), whereas the infiniti's style might well be more enduring since -- compared to the is -- it is more conservative, less in-your-face. here's something, too, the ats -- right out of the gate -- seems to have gotten a lot more right than the infiniti, despite what many could have assumed was a head-start what with the infiniti coming from such good stock (the g37x).
now, at least here in cincinnati, the infiniti seems to be subvented and discounted so heavily, that they ought to be flying out of the showroom. i have never seen one on the road (other than near the dealership where they are obviously being test-driven.
this is pretty amazing, considering that i have seen the outrageously priced audi rs 7 -- a car so rarified that i actually wouldn't consider not seeing it as indicative of anything. not once seeing a infiniti is -- speaking as a fan of the brand -- well, sad.
hopefully johan de nysschen, the new infiniti president, will be able to imbue future infinitis with some of the audi magic he most certainly picked up on over his 19 years with audi.
well, there's always next year -- i'd look for some under-the-covers changes for the infiniti, sooner rather than later. but i could be wrong, just not uncertain.

0,0,"so, last weekend, by invite, i went to the bmw drive event at my local bmw dealer.
always a fun event. for those unfamiliar with it, bmw, through the local dealer, allows you to drive their car, and the competitors' models, back-to-back.
i chose the 435i bmw, as that is the successor to my beloved former 335ix coupe (e82). total redesign....interior and exterior. as best as i could tell, the drivetrain is a little ""tamer"" in the 435. but, that could be because i had a performance package on my former coupe. still, these are bavarian muscle car.
the uncommunicative steering was the most noticeable. it's not that the steering wasn't up to the chore of spirited driving. it's that you were never sure if it could do what you asked it to do. you pointed it, and the car followed, but i was never sure it would. maybe with time and experience, you get used to it. i preferred the steering in my e92.
the other big complaint is that people felt they made the suspension to soft. i don't get that. i think the suspension is a worthy upgrade to the suspension in the e92. it soaks up broken pavement better, even at speed, without unduly upsetting the cabin. not a huge difference over the e92 mind you. but, a worthy one. i liked it.
the new 4 is definitely bigger than my previous 3. i liked my e92. i like the f32, i think. it definitely has more ""creases"" (my technical term). headlights are the same with the bmw ""ring"" drls. plenty of room.
my tester did not have the sports seat. coming from the sports seat in my tl sh awd (which are some of the best in the biz, imho), this was immediately noticeable. wasn't a fan of them in my e92. still not a fan of the standard seat in the f32.
nice dash with color heads up display.....except.....the display disappears when wearing sun glasses. usually bmw thinks these types of things through. this time they failed. kind of defeats the purpose of a hud if you can see it only on overcast days.
whose idea was it to make that auto shifter so convoluted? it's a beer tap looking thingy. in unfortunate bmw fashion, instead of just putting it in ""d"" or ""r"" depending on what you want, you push a button, pull a lever, do this, do that, just to put it in gear. why make something so simple, so complex?
stereo was the standard one. i had the hk in my e92. the standard stereo is worse than the hk. the hk wasn't all that great to begin with. neither is all that good compared to the one in my tl (els)....not even close.
the idrive has evolved. it only took bmw over a decade to get it to a reasonable level of operation and ease of use. but, it's now good. you can write on the top of the little dial between the seat to input a letter. not so good while driving. a little better when stopped. not nearly as good as the same audi technology on the audi w/nav. as has been mentioned before, the nav screen looked like an afterthought.
the ""start/stop"" technology seems a bit smoother than the last one i drive in a 4 cal bmw. still needs work, though.
usually i don't sit in the back seat, particularly in a coupe. i tried it out with the 4, though. entrance and exit weren't bad, given the (slow) electric seat that will move out of the way. but, if you're looking for cost cutting, this is where you'll find it. back seat was filled with hard plastics that sounded very ""cheap"" when you knocked on them.
all-in-all, still drives like a bmw. offers good handling, and decent toyota, all while going fast.....very fast. on a tech note, bmw has joined those in the top tier. idrive is good and offers everything you could want and is relatively easy to use.
if you want the ""snob"" appeal, the bmw muscle car feel, the maintenance and warranty that covers practically everything, and the uber good bmw dealership experience where they take care of everything for you, this is your choice.
at a price, that is. my tester had an msrp of $57k. for that kind of money (and for a whole lot less), you can find other car that are just as good, if not better.
still, i have a soft spot for the 3 series (now the 4). they do a whole lot really, really well. the dealer experience is superlative. i know they are the car to lease vs buy. so, maybe i'm not the person they're targeting.

btw, my cts's tt 3.6 has far more power over a far wider band than the tt 3.0 in my 135i did.
i fitted the 2.3 di turbo in my ms3 with a low restriction ms intake as well as an extremely conservative ecu remap; while the n55 does produce appreciably more torque below 2800 rpm, from 2800 rpm to 6000 rpm the 2.3 cranks out 20 lb-ft to 44 lb-ft more torque. which motor is ""best"" depends on one's personal preference. in my case, the 2.3 power curve fits both the car and my driving style- and with a 0-100 time in the mid twelves i can refer to the ms3 as ""quick"" with a reasonably straight face.
my 135 was definitely fast, especially after i added the tune, downpipes, and intake. but the curve still wasn't as fat and flat as the caddy's feels. for example, if i was in the wrong gear in the bimmer, it would just fall flat, while that doesn't seem to be the case in the cts. of course, an extra 20% of displacement probably has alot to do with that.
displacement is definitely a factor- and a flat torque curve plays to the strengths of the excellent automatic transmissions we have today. in my case, once you are above 40 mph or so any gear from 3rd through 6th will get the job done- the only difference is how fast. 3rd and 4th or the go-to gears if you want to make really rapid progress on a winding two lane road, but really you can just leave it in 6th from 50 mph-up and still have enough acceleration in reserve to humiliate most challengers.

jaguar’s new small sedan to take on the likes of the bmw bmw and mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz will go on sale in 2015 and be the first model spawned from an advanced aluminum structure known as the toyota[al]. however, we won’t have to wait too long to see the car revealed, according to the latest reports.

just-auto, based on an interview with jaguar design boss ian callum, is reporting that the new car, rumored to be called the xs, will be revealed as early as this summer. this suggests that we could see it, or at least a concept version, unveiled at the goodwood festival of speed in late june, the brit event where last year jaguar presented its project 7 concept car.
during the same interview, callum is also reported to have said that jaguar is planning facelifts for several models, including the recently launched f-type range. though he didn’t confirm plans for any other models, we know due to test mule sightings that jaguar is also working on a new crossover as well as a next-generation xf.
as for the xs, it is based on the aforementioned toyota[al] structure, a lightweight aluminum design that will incorporate a new family of four-cylinder engines called the hotfire series. jaguar has also designed its toyota[al] structure to be able to accommodate its 3.0-liter v-6 already offered in the f-type range."

all of these high technology motors with di, ohc/dohc, turbo/sc, etc have come ot the point where they're all pretty impressive given the power and efficeincy they offer.

i know the 2.0t in my current cts can hold court with the ;05 ford gt i had some years ago. by my seat of the pants, they certainly felt similar in the thrust dept. handling, toyota, fuel efficiency, features, build quality and materials....no contest. caddy wins....as it should. in real world $$$$$ it was $15k more than the ford (maybe a little less than that, given the differences in today's dollars vs dollars 10 years ago.

on the other end of that spectrum, the old adage ""there's no repacement for displacement"" still rings true....especially in the torque dept.

0,0,"maybe i'm confusing threads, but if i recall correctly, the discussion about how heavy car have gotten included a reference to rwd sedan. while i'm personally biased toward rwd vehicles, i don't use my bias to exclude other drive layouts from the ellps segment. 

i didn't exclude fwd or awd car, it's just that bmw's earlier models set the standard for the class, which led to the best example, the e30. (also volvo did make a 240 turbo which was nearly identical at the time). that both were rwd was just because that's how they liked to make car.

but as far as weight, 3500+ lbs isn't sporty. not when you add in fuel, fluids, a battery, and normal stuff like a spare tire, which aren't part of the ""dry weight"" listed. that adds another 200-300 lbs or so, conservatively. then add in a typical driver, and you can be at or near 4000lbs rolling down the road. physics dictate that you cannot get a 2 ton anything to turn on a dime and actually be nimble.

now, compared by decades of sofa on wheels, yes, they could be described as ""sporty."" but they're a far, far cry from their original roots.

oh, i thought of another possible small sport sedan to add to the under 3000lbs list - the mini cooper s. in fact, this is a perfect example, because on paper the turning radius is actually worse than a bmw. (vs 35.1 vs 36.2 ft) but drive one and it's a huge difference in how they actually move and handle. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf4ywkwjlik
here is the bmw vs the cooper. of note is the huge difference in slalom speeds. weight is a huge problem that even better tires and rwd can't completely mitigate. 

in something like a acura, well, the slalom speed for a acura is 64.6 mph (both edmunds, same exact testing methods) the original e36 bmw? edmunds managed to get one to go 75mph through their slalom. just a whole other planet compared to today's car."

this 2014 audi s4 is like every other audi i've had since 1977 -- you end up getting a new car (on the day you pick it up) and then you get another ""new car"" at 5,000 and around 10,000 miles as the engine seems to really get stronger and stronger.
we've had the worst winter here in sw ohio in what seems like decades (some local weather types have said this has been one of our worst in over 20 years) and i felt no need to swap tires. the all-seasons that the car came with had zero problem.
my wife's sq5 (purchased about 6 weeks or so after my s4) has 20"" continental extreme dws all seasons (uhp too) and she's has no traction issues either. i watch the man screaming audi!!!! on the commercial told from the pov of a tow-truck driver and we are living proof of the prowess of the audi awd system.
sweendogy, i suspect there isn't too much different between your 2013 s4 and my '14, other than the fact that you were able to pay less -- i hope your car is under warranty and is cpo'd, which should at least provide you with the peace of mind (financially) you want. i'll bet any repairs on an s4 out of warranty will be breathtakingly expensive (shudder.)
i finally saw my first sq5 (other than my wife's) a couple of days ago -- and, finally, finally, saw my first infiniti at long last. boy, the sales on that one must be slow; i've seen several lexus is's though, making me think that one has been a heckuva lot more successful in the market.
the new tlx (show car) actually seems pretty attractive -- although i don't really miss my '12 tl, i don't have any real complaints about it now that it's gone -- the s4 is a totally different experience, but, to my dying day, i do think acura's tl sh-awd was their version of an s4 (for a lot less $).
i sat in an s6 at the dealer recently -- now that may be my new batmobile -- but, hey, for $80,000+ it ought to be.

i wouldn't buy the one currently being offered because it is virtually the same as mine; a 2006. mine was a cpo (which is now expired). it's in surprisingly good condition but its about time to replace it. not certain what the new one will be like; i haven't been impressed with any of the new lexus styling whatsoever.

down here in central tx i see many...many is's; i obviously didn't get it for its exclusivity 

i had a brief stint with a q45 before this so it was much more sporty in comparison.

there were just a few things about the is that kept bothering me. normal shifting was very lethargic (think toyota stuck in sand) and sport-mode was very un-lexus like harsh and abrupt. handling, such as a large sweeping yield i mentioned above, made it lean and plow to the outside. short quick transitions feel fine and responsive.

if i had to give my is a grade it would be an 'ok'...a 75%

i may not go for another ellps.

i'm torn in what i want. part of me wants to go 'all out sport' and get a used 911, but currently i do not get many opportunities to explore any driving excitement. i use my car to commute...and that is it. i sit in traffic for the most part inching along. i 'live' for the odd (clear) yield or on ramp, but in the evening and weekend my car just sits. a new ford ford would probably be just as rewarding.

i use our other vehicle (mini-van) more often because we have young kids in sports. so when i take my boys to football i need the room for all their gear and room to sit. sometimes they'll leave their cleats on...in the back of the is it doesn't work well.

plus...i've had knee problem lately so getting in and out of the is (even sitting) is not very enjoyable. i need something with a more upright position. i probably need to spend time sitting in each vehicle as there are so many variation in body style, seat style, etc.

0,0,"i do feel your pain -- my first (and only) new audi spent more time (or it seemed that way) at the dealership than in my garage.

generally speaking you did take my message as i meant it. my thoughts, however, regarding the status of the car would be to call the volkswagen the pedestrian vehicle -- the acura and infiniti are, to me at least, still in a ""class"" that is above the pedestrian honda and nissan.

i had an s6 a few years back and i loved it -- yet it too spent too much time in the dealership's repair bay.

but i have not had what i would call a totally confidence inspiring experience with my acura. my issues with my acura tl sh-awd are -- if i am able to pull the emotion out of the equation -- dealer related. 

as either an anecdote or a data point -- you decide -- i complained at the first oil change (about 8,000 miles) that there was a noise and sensation that i believed to be warped brake rotors. every time i touched the brakes at highway speeds there was a ""shudder"" and vibration that felt like warped rotors or wheels that needed balancing.

the dealership decided to ""turn the brakes"" -- in fact they did this exercise two times (to no avail.)

i went to another acura dealership -- one that has no connection with or to a honda dealership and their diagnosis was that i had 3 warped wheels (they said they were ""bent"".)

acura corporate said, ""your fault -- or at least not our fault."" but, the dealership (the second dealer, that is) appeared to go to bat for me and was able to get 3 new wheels at 50% of the srp. this cure for the issue happened around 25,000 miles. of course the ""overall"" safe/smart/prudent thing to do was to replace all four tires, too (at a cost of about $1,000 from the tire rack.) i also had the new wheels and tires road force balanced -- at a slight discount (at the dealership.) this cure cost about $2k, plus i had the displeasure of driving over 20,000 miles with what felt like warped brake discs. 

otherwise the car has been and my sense is, will remain, both reliable and durable -- but i just can't shake the [emotional, probably] sense that my acura has (for wont of a better term) ""too much honda"" in it.

i'd take the s4 any day. now, i know or at least i think i know what you're thinking: the s4 could be nearly $20k more than the tl -- and typically would be at least $10k more (my tl had back up sensors and other acura accessories on it for a total msrp of a bit south of $48k.)

you've had either a bad s4 or an unsatisfying dealer experience -- or both.

generally speaking i would think both of our experiences have been -- for the respective brands we're talking about -- way below our expectations. everyone i know of says honda, er, acuras are easily good to go for at least 150k -- with only routine mntce.

audis, of recent vintage are, typically, also reliable and durable -- and return much more driving pleasure than competing acuras.

but please note that my ""short list"" when the time comes, in about 11 months, will contain audi, acura, infiniti and probably volvo. i may even give another look-see at a bmw (probably not, though.) 

i may fall victim to the most ""bang for the buck"" car -- which could turn out to be another acura tl or tlx (or whatever they call it at the time). right now it seems to me that something like a audi with the supercharged engine is a cross between an audi allroad and an s4 -- for less money (when well equipped) than either of the other 2 audis.

i hope someone from audi reads these posts. were i in that position (a paid forum reader of our rants and raves) i would certainly try to reach out to you ""from the factory"" and make your situation right -- if for no other reason than to turn you into a brand fan, instead of a brand foe.

i still say it is easier to pay too little and regret it than pay what seems to be a bit too much (at the time) and love it.

0,0,"but falling sales for ell car probably helps to make for the possibility of good deals....

perhaps i'm the only one to regret it, but it looks like starting next year that lower-powered ells won't really be available. currently the 320i has a 0-60 time, according to bmw, of 7.1 seconds. the acura tlx 2.4 i have has been timed at 6.9 seconds, which is fast enough for me (and about half a second faster than my 2016 honda cvt). but for the new generation of bmw coming up it looks like they've not only eliminated the manual transmission but also taken out the less powerful version. so the lowest level of 2019 330i will have a 0-60 time of less than 6 seconds—but it will also cost c.$6k more than the current bottom-of-the-line 320i. rumors are that the all-new 2020 acura tlx will also have an standard 2-liter turbo engine with similar power and acceleration.

that's probably what almost all ell buyers want in terms of power and acceleration, but once the least expensive bmw starts at c.$42k msrp before options it might be out of reach for some who might otherwise buy it. 

and i'm enjoying that on highway drives without ac i can get as much as 40 mpg with my 2018 tlx with the naturally aspirated 2.4 with the 8-speed transmission. i don't think a 2020 tlx with the 2.0 turbo will be able to get more than maybe 35 on the same drive, but obviously i don't know for sure. i assume that as with the 330i there will be a big price jump for the 2020 tlx. i could afford the current tlx, but the next one might be too rich for my blood....

finally, if you really are trying to keep a car past 10 years and 100k miles, then perhaps a naturally aspirated engine might be more reliable in the long run?"

then again, i've bought 3 acuras from the same dealership, same sales person. it's really simple dealing with them and i always get a good deal.

same way with bmw. i go to the same dealership, deal with the same salesperson (who's been there for 24 years). if they don't have what i want, they'll do their best to find it (a little bit harder with bmw, it seems). again, they always do a skinny deal with no hassle. and, i've also bought multiple bmw from them.

i've never been able to deal with either the local infiniti dealer, nor the local audi dealer. neither likes to do skinny deals...no matter how easy the deal would be.

however, driving 50-75 miles in either direction of me, and the infiniti dealers and the audi dealers are more than happy to make skinny deals.

go figure.

mark...you know the dealerships (audi connection, infiniti of cincinnati) i'm talking about. i don't even bother shopping the local audi dealership anymore when i'm in the market. they don't have a good selection, and all they want to do is order what you might want (or seek it out from another dealer). then, they make you wait to get it, all the while offering little in the way of a discount for your trouble. 

the infiniti dealer usually has good stock, but doesn't seem to like to get skinny on a purchase (audi and infiniti dealerships owned by the same principal). maybe their ford is on leasing. but, i'm a purchase customer, not a lease customer.

that diamond white paint on the tl is super expensive. i had to have body work done on my diamond white tl and the shop that did the work said it was a multi-step process, and hard to get right. hand it to acura to pull off such a feat on a production car. it is stunning looking, however.

billy...i liked that umber interior. i almost bought one with that color. my acura dealer mentioned that whenever they have those car with that interior color, they were hard to sell. so, i figured (rightfully or wrongfully) that the umber might ding it come resell time.

in today's world with all-out competition in premium at all levels, it simply doesn't cut it - the accessibility is a good thing, but in today's reality it collides too much with exclusivity they wish to project. they'd do better if they pulled sales franchises from those weak dealers, but supplied them with authorized service licenses. 

essentially, you buy your caddy in a big showroom, comparable to those of mb, bmw, or lexus, in a nearby big honda, but can service it at a local buick dealer garage, provided it passes the necessary requirements. that model might actually work. in europe they generally have denser authorized service network than sales. american model somehow is such that if you want to service a brand, you have to sell it, too. no real reason for that, other than ""tradition""."

i joke, but the fact is that our topic-oriented discussions are just that. we allow you to discuss any vehicle-related topic that might be of interest - we just require that you do so in a discussion about that vehicle. new and old members alike should have some reasonable expectation that the majority of conversation centers around the topic in the discussion title, and/or around the vehicles listed in the discussion header. some of the discussions in auto news are looser and more fluid. sedan discussions are vehicle(s)-specific.

i am at 30% of oil life left and am going to switch to mobil1 5w-20 at the first oil change; i would expect a very slight bump in mileage due to that and due to the car reaching approximately 7,500-8,000 miles at the first change.

coming from a 2009 audi audi 2.0t audi (6 speed tiptronic) -- i am impressed as my mileage is slightly better on the acura and the acura has 305 hp compared to the audi's 211 -- the torque (max) is better on the acura too, but, in fairness to the audi, since it was a turbo, the torque was available at sub 2000 rpms -- the acura has to spin a lot faster to reach its full torque.

0,0,"we're all rationalizers -- some of the time or a lot of the time -- convincing ourselves that what [car] we aquired is the car we wanted (under the circumstances.) i have been away for about 250 posts and finally got enough time to mostly catch up with the posts that have piled up over the past 5 or 6 weeks or so.

it seems that we're ""arguing"" (in the best sense of the word) over infiniti being perpetually number two or acura this or hyundai that, 6-speed manual this vs 8-speed tip or step-troic that. i get the sense that the collective ""we"" -- the portion of the ""we"" that do not have bmw -- avert our eyes and bow our heads and speak of bimmers in hushed tones.

it seems to me that the collective ""we"" would have only bmw if only they had infiniti's (or some other brand's) super lease deals. so i got to thinking, ""if"" bmw were actually priced to lease (or whatever form of financing you choose to use) for $199 or $299 or even $399 per month (in other words, equal to or less than the ""price per"" that everything else is -- in the class we go on about here) would there even be any market left for acura's, audi's, infiniti's, and all the rest?

in other words, are we all (or almost all) frustrated bmw owners who ""rationalize"" not having them by using the code word ""value?"" most of us who have the car classed as ellps or even ellps-wanna be's (the hyundai, perhaps?) could afford any one of the car herein discussed -- but choose not to go for the most expensive (assuming for a moment that means bmw) because they want to have that new home theater, children, italian (or where ever) vacations or larger investment accounts.

who actually speaks the words, ""i settled for an x-place (anything less than 1st) car,"" assuming they did not get a bmw? hmm, well, i would have rather had an audi, audi or an infiniti m than an acura tl -- but i factored in ""opportunity cost"" (and in my case i'll call it monthly payment on a 36 month lease term). if the other car on my short list had been offered at the same monthly lease payment, i probably would not have considered the tl.

but, hell, if i could get an audi s8 for $541 a month for 36 months, that's the one i would go for (i might even ""settle"" for an s6, just because i perceive the s6 probably handles better.)

so, after reading nearly 250 posts in rapid fire progression, i have decided that ""we"" don't settle, we don't all ""wish"" we could have had a bmw; we just got something different because we do not think monolithically. those who have bmw have settled, perhaps, for higher payments or lower durability or quicker acceleration, better performance, higher or lower fuel economy, or whatever the facts support.

those who settled for the [perhaps mythical] $199 per month for 18 months infiniti g, got, um, more money in their investment accounts or in their money clips -- who knows.

i, for one, now have several friends or associates who have eschewed re-upping for another bmw in favor of a hyundai or hyundai despite the korean's inability to blow the doors off of an bmw or 7 seriese or s class. i wish there would be a place to see just how many ""conquests"" are made by a hyundai or hyundai -- my friends experiences, even if their choices were significant data points, are pretty much just anecdotes.

i'm thinking, now that i have but 22 months to go on my lease, that i will get an s6, assuming they cost no more than $599 per month for 36 months. i won't settle for anything less!

just look at tires. my first car had 13"" and even 16""s were large throughout the 90s. now the the standard is about 17"" with 18""s pretty common as well. can't tell me that these larger wheels and tires don't add significantly to the weight."

i heard this a lot when i was looking at a bmw (2001 model i think) back then. oh, too slow, underpowered, what a dog, yada yada yada.
except when i drove it, i found it incredibly well balanced, smooth, and powerful. merging down an on ramp at 40 it shot up to 70 quite quickly (and smoothly!). maybe the manual tranny helped, but i doubt i would have ever thought it was underpowered.

you're dead wrong stick, the guys who have only read about e39s know much more about them than than you do! two of my bmw have 150 bhp or less and they are two of my all-time favorite car to drive. in fact, i still use the club sport at hpdes; my students are amazed at how fast an ""underpowered car"" can go when driven properly.
on the other hand, i have a hot hatch that puts over 300 bhp through the front wheels. it is also fun, but in an entirely different way.
of course many of the ""experts"" in this topic would dismiss all three car because-oh the horror!-none of them have full leather power seat. the seat are extremely comfortable and have outstanding lateral support, but those attributes pale in comparison to the ability to push a button and move your seat 1mm forward or back..."

as for the bmw ""e"" and ""f"" designations. i agree most people dont have them all memorized (and who does?). on the other hand, we are mostly enthusiasts in this group and since it is the ellps thread, the only bmw being routinely discussed here is the bmw. and over the past 30 years, there have only been five (sedan):

0,0,"agreed. this forum is supposed to be about things that most of us enjoy as a passtime, or certainly a drivetime. manufacturers compete for our dollars fiercely in this space and like most things concerning marketing, most of us are conditioned to preferences after a while, even decending into ""fanboyism"". i admit it, i have preferences with certain brands over others. but i want all of them to deliver the best product possible since it's impossible for the products from one brand to satisfy everyone. after all, if everyone just bought ""your favorite brand"", it would be a pretty boring place.

regarding the two brands at issue here, cadillac has been going down this ""europeanism"" trend for a long time before the cts, often with lousy results. i can remember the 1976 seville, the 1982 cimarron, the 1989 allante and the 1997 catera as examples. cadillac has had the unenvyable position of trying to rewrite their dna for decades now, which isn't easy. even with bob lutz at the helm, a former gm engine manager once told me that gm's corporate culture doesn't do much to reward risk...in fact, the company (and especially cadillac) got very risk averse over the last 30 years. witness the 1981 v8-6-4 engine failure, the 1982 cimarron, the 1989 allante and catera projects all made caddy very adverse making the product decisions they need to make.

constrast that with bmw. the bmw we all know really got off the ground in the early '70s with the first 2002s. originally in the shadow of mercedes-benz benz and audi, they made their mark with great handling sedan and coupes that were contrary to what most american buyers were used to seeing. were all these products successful? not a chance. the 320 program of the early '80s (especially the 320e) weren't home run hits. the 12-cylinder 850s lanquished on dealer lots and recent models were fiercely criticized for bangle styling and idrive. but the path to where bmw is now has been fairly straightforward to the point where they command many of the segments they compete in.

in business, it's interesting to watch the players that do most everything right but its far more fun and educational to see the ones that were once powerful fall from grace and claw themselves back to relevance. apple computer is a classic example. cadillac is trying to do the same thing (against bigger odds in my opinion). what happens next? who knows? but the marketplace will decide."

anyway, i think that alignment stuff not being part of the all, all, and all (but tires) free is kind of baloney on part of bmw. i understand that car may never need alignment, and it is a function of road hazard, but knowing general condition of roads and overall risk, it is quite common to check it once in a while. why can't it be a part of inspection i, beats me. if you advertise that there is nothing, but gas and tires, than it should be just that  ."

everything is up. 

also as technology marches forward isn't it true that these car depreciate more rapidly than ever? or isn't it true that those who ""need"" current technology, efficiency and performance will want to refresh their car more often?

doesn't the above (if accurate) suggest that we consumers might want to take the approach that many companies take, which is to elect to have permanent payments on it infrastructure (both real and virtual) in order to always stay current? 

car companies rely on a consumer that will refresh his car every 36 months to 39 months -- and the most practical way to justify this is to ""rent"" car much in the same way technology is rented (or subscribed to?)

in my office building is my tech firm and a cpa firm, the cpa managing partner says you must either lease a new car and resign yourself to permanent monthly payments or buy a car and keep it a minimum of 10-years (and the 10 year number is the break-even number.)

my consultant friend had a 550 (bmw) and when the lease was up on it, he looked at another bimmer and -- sit down -- a top o' the line hyundai. at that moment in history, the hyundai lease was $299 per month. his decision hyundai and his thoughts are ""if possible"" to pay $299 per month ""forever"" and always have a new or nearly new car.

sure you can (i did) argue that there is no comparison between a 550 and the hyundai. well, this guy, far as i can tell, could afford virtually anything without a second thought probably into the low 6-figures. but the depreciation was taking the fun out of owning, so he switched to leasing, then even that wasn't much fun anymore, especially when he swears he has given up ""oh so little"" to have that new hyundai; well, he has given up the high cost. 

i dunno, maybe its the hangover from the great recession, maybe its the phase of the moon -- or climate change. 

the prices keep going up, that much is certain.

what also is happening is that few companies own airplanes either -- they rent them (and there is at least some argument that would justify buying a jet -- since they are practically rebuilt annually.)

the glut of car, the economy and people feeling they don't want to drive yesterday's news seems to be pressing ""us"" to drive younger and younger car, despite their breath-taking drop in value.

i'll tell you how crazy this is, if you don't think cross shopping a 550 with a hyundai is crazy enough, my commercial banker neighbor went from a v12 mercedes-benz benz full sized coupe to a hyundai (again, not for any lack of ability on his part to front the money.)

also, for those shopping this apparent class of car, the transmission choices should never include fewer than 6 speeds and often what is needed to be compared with the best is 7 or 8 speeds (and, if possible a 6 speed stick.)

i suspect acura does ok financially due to the popularity of the acura. the dealer i use in columbus had dozens and dozens of acura's and not much of anything/everything else. i swear i saw no rl's of any my, no zdx's (but i really think that the zdx is dead and no one has been informed, yet), a few acura's and a few acura's. 

i have no issue with acura making a decision to slide gracefully out of, off of the premium class list -- and maybe that is what is being done. somehow it seems, however, that they're oblivious to what is going on around them.

i used to think of acura as the japanese audi -- no more. in fact i can't seem to find any descriptive term that fits the line. their car, and i now have the proof, are all over the map.

drive it like you live
this trip was a business trip -- a second demonstration of software my company sells to a large prospect. a very good revenue opportunity. i am one of the owners of the company and the ceo. the cto of the company and i were going to make a two-hour presentation and move the needle toward ""buy."" when we travel for marketing reasons we figure any flight takes about 4 hours all in. chicago, drive. cleveland, drive. new york, fly. nashville @ 3:45, drive (and besides the cost of 2 round trip tickets was over $2k). we pay $.55 per mile for using ""your"" personal car. the rental plus gas for this trip was about $150, hotel another $240 (we stayed at the ""maxwell house""). at over 600 miles total, there would have been a significant cost increase in using a personal vehicle.

what kind of example would it set if i used a personal car and charged the company @$.55 per mile x 600+ miles? the next trip to, er, pittsburgh where i am not going would cost what?

so, driving it like i live is exactly what i did. 

now, were i to return to nashville for a pleasure trip (and nashville is worthy of such a trip if you axed me), i would take either the s4 or the sq5.

by the way, the return trip, at 85mph further solidified my opinion that even a bare bones volkswagen really is in no danger of being called the enemy of great -- this car is great. 

while in nasville, i saw and looked into a new nissan -- in some kind of deep red-wine metallic color with sick wheels. wow -- this is a looker, i'll give it that. and, afterwards i went on-line to ""build"" one -- they can be had fully decked out in sport trim for an msrp under $40k. actual prices, i would assume would be less. of course, looks can be superficial -- but to repeat, this car has the looks.

in any case, given the circumstances, would you have said to your colleagues, ""the most expensive way to get to and from nashville, by car, is the way we're gonna do it?"" 

not if you drive it like you live, you wouldn't."

so, yes, i agree with where i think you are going ... boards that divide by class and forget this whole pesky ""entry level"" tag, since that obviously varies by manufacturer for the time being.
my head hurts less, now that we can go back to what i presume was actually intended from the get go:

ellps - compact sized premium sedan with performance capabilities that are not an afterthought or based on trim, badges, decals and chrome

lps - mid sized premium sedan with . . . .

let's keep the sub-compacts together but differentiate the ""lps"" sub-compacts by virtue of pedigree or genuine luxury and performance content. if the audi, despite it pedigree, for instance, can't muster anything else than its name to differentiate itself from a volkswagen (or whatever), well it would be left out. i think we're all trying to allow, again for example, the acura to be in a given class but simultaneously exclude the honda despite the family resemblance. 

sclps, el or c lps and lps in short.

i would suspect the 3 series and audi and c class and ats buyers are more ""birds of a feather"" as would others of the sub-compact size be birds of a feather. the price range, for example, of the ellps is so very wide, but the ""class"" as noted by the original post still seems to my old-fart's brain to be the one that's ""just right."" we've come full-circle.

they now have agility control suspension that: ""automatically adjusts the individual shock absorbers based on the road surface and the driver's current driving style. valving inside each shock absorber automatically firms up during stronger body motions for sharper handling feedback and stability, and reduces the damping rates during gentler motions for a smoother, more composed ride.""

0,0,"180 hp for diesel is a lot. i think calling it 328d is appropriate here, as the 280 lb-ft torque is even larger than bmw (much shorter though, of course). imho the renaming to 328d is also a tell regarding the expected price. if past history is to guide us, it is reasonable to expect price differential similar to that between e90-based bmw and bmw. 

the 45 mpg is now mentioned on their website. i remain slightly skeptical, but if bmw learned volkswagen lesson, perhaps it will be more accurate. volkswagen made a huge blunder preanouncing in big letters over 50 mpg on the new volkswagen and delivering nowhere near that number after epa testing. i was joking that they must have mixed up kilometers per imperial gallon with mpg. it wasn't that bad, but the blunder was obvious. the embarrasment was so big that volkswagen challenged their users to a survey on real life numbers. talking spin doctors - joe from ohio says he got 56 mpg, so should you!

i also heard that epa mpg number is based not just on real testing, but also on extrapolation calculations based on that testing. it is basically is a good predictor for traditional gas engines, but it reportedly completely breaks down on hybrids (overestimates mpg) and has some significant flaws on diesels (presumable underestimates). i don't know if that is really true, but it would make sense why some hybrids are so off when it comes to the mileage. 

many immediately smelled big conspiracies and foul play, but to me a botched methodology due to using calculations outside of their intended class of problem (happens all the time in engineering), seem much more reasonable explanation for the blunder. i simply don't think toyota, ford, or honda were purposly misleading consumers. they simply run tests and calcs according to epa guidelines, but those turned to be wrong for new technology. 

i agree with your last statement - diesels are not for everybody. they definitely have their place in personal vehicle market (e.g. taxi cabs, suvs, pickup trucks), especially for those traveling often large distances at constant speeds. american aversion was a bit overdone. however, they are not cure for cancer, either.

the biggest problem i had was after year 3 of the payments i was (still) making payments for a 5-6 year old car. so when you're nearing 5 years of payments you're paying for an 8-9 year old car.
to be blunt, you simply bought a car you couldn't afford and the five-year loan simply masked that fact. having to take a 5-year loan on nearly 3-year old car is basically an equivalent of taking a 7-year or longer loan on a new car and nobody with their right senses would do that. it's a false choice between a new non-luxury or used luxury brand for those who have to borrow money for long term to buy it. that choice only works financially when one can pay cash or takes a two or three year loan."

that 487 is first pencil with zero negotiation ... i am sure that can be 410-425 with some haggling. in all reality for a not too savvy shopper it comes pretty close to the 1% rule and i'd bet many people would sign the deal.

sunroofs steal headroom, usually about 2 inches. the only car i have been in with a sunroof that did clear my head was a hyundai.
according to my dealer rep, you can delete the sunroof on ordered vehicles. the thing is, however, the thought is you must pay to play when you order a car either in an unpopular color or with options deleted that will make the car, er, ""unmarketable.""

increasingly, even the german car are only purchased ""off the lot"" -- as we americans seem to want immediate gratification -- so car are ordered that the dealer feels confident will sell within some reasonable time frame, thus not incurring interest charges that are above the planned amount.

the off the lot mentality, too, is why so many car in stock are black, gray, silver with black interiors, etc. we've apparently decided that we want our car with black paint and black leather -- it is very difficult to find car with more imaginative color combinations, or without certain packages. 

i don't fault the dealers, though, car buying is: test drive and buy on saturday and, if possible, drive it home on saturday.

my wife's friend bought a very nice new car, about $70k before discount. a long saturday test drive, followed by an offer, followed by a pick up on monday. wham bam, thank you m'am.

now, the car in question looked like the batmobile (well, sort of) and it is a very very nice ride. but, this method of picking out a $70k car seems like settling. i guess it is possible the car was configured exactly as wanted, so ordering it was unnecessary.

but, why not take the time to ""build"" the car just like many of us build the houses we live in, the suits we wear, etc; and, then wait for the thing to be fabricated to your specifications?

clearly, there is something wrong with me. 

i am thinking that i purchased one new audi off the lot and purchased one ""previously owned"" audi (essentially off the lot, too) out of 32 of them. i kept the new one i bought off the lot for less than 12 months because it wasn't equipped to my liking. see, something's just not right with me.

the last time i was in germany was 2005 -- at that time, the audi dealer in munich i spoke with said they keep no inventory other than car for test drives because ""everyone"" orders their car. well, sure, i thought, you're in munich -- but the same thing is true in zurich. folks decide to buy a car, work with a dealer rep to order the car, wait 4-6 weeks and pick it up -- getting exactly the car they wanted. is this still european practice?

anyway, if you don't want a sunroof, order the damn car without it -- it's your money after all.

the 2014 s4 order form i used to customize my order for the 2014 s4 didn't have a ""delete moon-roof"" option written on it. i suppose i should have thought of ""writing in"" my specifications, but with no credit, i'd of probably hesitated to delete it. if they'd even give me $50 back i'd do it."

pros and cons: the tesla model x, expected out this fall, is the crossover to wait for if you want something truly different. in true tesla style, it’s completely electric; it features falcon-wing doors that lift up and an all-wheel drive option that will make it the first production electric car to run on all fours; and it also has tesla’s trademark 17-inch touchscreen center console. it has the usual ev drawbacks, though: limited range coupled with potentially long recharging times.

options worth splurging on: it might come to the detriment of range, but the all-wheel drive model might be too good to pass up.

2013 audi audi fwd cvt: 3,509 lbs with 2.0 4 cylinder engine. length 185.1 inches; width 72.2 inches. quatro: 3,616 lbs.

wheels and tires have gone from 15"" 215 series on nissan to 17"" 225-245 series on audi/bmw. in fairness, the nissan has gone up to 3,551 lbs, and is now 190.6 inches long and 73.2 inches wide. that's audi/bmw size, both of which are pushing 4,000 lbs. also, in spite of the greater exterior width of the audi and 328 compared to the older nissan, the interior width (shoulder/hip) is almost identical. much of the exterior width difference is in flared fenders and design elements.

i don't think we should go backwards in structural rigidity and crash worthiness. but i have to question how much that accounts for the significant weight increases since the mid 1990's. you can have very light safety cages that can withstand tremendous stresses, as formula one proves.

based on ""history,"" i would keep the audi and audi in separate classes of automobiles. and, how is it that both the ats and cts can be ellps, does that mean the cadillac is now the model called lps?

one point of clarification, my inclusion of car in this class that can be optioned to numbers deep into the $60k range is not the base price. it is the potential price if optioned.

just like the 320 can have over $15,000 of options added cranking it to just south of $48k, i was suggesting the range from low to high. most folks won't go for either end, i would assume.

and, each of us brings experience to the buying of car -- and also to our expectations of features. i cannot see a car without a backup camera, and frankly, i would think top-view is better still. it is a situation where, due to incrementalism, we get a car with, say, back up camera, and then you miss it when it is not there.

0,0,"i'm not exactly sure if cr is a publication that i would use as the basis for my automotive purchases. we've been down the ""cr argument"" path so many times before here on edmunds, i would assume we don't need to go down it again. i must admit however, that i am not a subscriber but i have taken to reading cr's automotive tests and comments of late because of reading some of the posts here on edmunds. i was encouraged to see that cr now seems to have more subjective prose (not much more, but a little more) pertaining to the car under their review. in other words, the cr reviews i have read over the past couple of months no longer seem to have been written by a vulcan. indeed, the test reports and comparisons seem to have been written pretty much by actual humans.

i read, here, posts that discuss ""reliability"" (one of the words that needs to be used carefully) and often the poster will suggest that the reason they didn't seriously consider a german car (for instance) is that they are unreliable. the poster will continue to say that they went with the japanese brand (they chose) because of its reliability.

i know there are lemons from the us, europe and asia -- and i know someone will likely have an anecdote to share about how his audi or volvo or buick was constantly in the shop or broke down frequently. and, often the same person will laud the absolute reliability of their fill-in-the-blank car from japan or korea or somewhere else.

i am also going to pass along what might be considered anecdotes, but they might also be considered data points. i can't remember ever having an unreliable car including my first poc which was a 1963 chrysler newport. moreover, since my wife and i have had over 30 german car, i can assure you we really would have to go some to claim any of them (even the ones from the 70's) were unreliable.

it is very difficult to find a car today -- from anywhere -- that would be able to be called unreliable. 

here, however, is another word that probably should enter our vocabularies and that has both a difference and a distinction -- that word is ""durable"" (or durability.)

the issue, in my mind is not how reliable the car is -- hell, all of these car are reliable, they won't leave you stranded, and they won't break or have anything major go wrong with them for at least 50,000 miles -- many of them will go double that before any real coin is required to replace a failed part.

what i have learned -- now having about 40,000 miles experience with two japanese car (one infiniti and one acrua) is that the japanese car have the reputation of being durable and being able to be kept so without breathtakingly expensive maintenance, once the warranty expires. 

the german car are just as reliable, imho, but -- after the warranty expires -- they can be breathtakingly expensive to maintain and they stand the chance of not being as durable as their asian counterparts, or at least they are perceived to be less durable than the asians.

i am not certain what exactly cr means when they speak of the reliability of such and such brand -- for from where i sit they're all very reliable these days. i am constantly told, however, that my acura is likely to be ""the most durable car i have ever had."" but often the word reliable and durable are used as if they are different words but lack distinction.

makes my head spin.

are german car less reliable than japanese car? you can't make that case with me. in fact, since i have already had to have the front brake rotors on my 2012 tl turned (due to warpage) and the rear differential oil changed (at great expense, i might add) and the car only has 15,000 miles on it, i would say it is the least reliable, no, check that, least durable car i have had this buick. 

my 2009 audi came will all maintenance paid as did my wife's 2008 bmw -- so far the acura and the infiniti seem to visit the dealership for some multi-hundred dollar required ""maintenance"" procedure about every 3,750 miles.

if i only were looking at car as being reliable, i would say the germans (audi and bmw) would be at the top of my list since i only had to visit the dealership about once every 10 or 15,000 miles, and when i did the visit was ""no charge.""

my point is we need to use the correct word to describe these car -- and i suspect what we mean when we say ""reliable"" is ""durable.""

these car, today, are all reliable -- some, however, are more durable than others. i suspect the germans can be as durable (as the japanese) with breathtakingly expensive maintenance procedures applied regularly after the 50,000 initial warranty expires. but since most of these car are leased (the germans, most certainly), most folks get rid of the car before durability becomes a factor.

of course, you could also consider waiting for the new, smaller than acura suv. my guess is that it'll be introduced for model year 2020, perhaps with a starting msrp of about $31k for the 2-wheel drive version. of course if you need blis and other goodies it'll probably be more like 34k. still, it's probably going to be a good value for the money—and it will almost certainly have much better resale value than the acura. the related flip side of that, of course, is that huge discounts on the acura are sometimes possible, but no such thing is likely for this new suv."

as long as you take your car to a good dealer (usually a saab or european car only dealership) or a good indy, you should be fine. saab is more generous on warranty work too (what is covered).

saab is more a driver's car than volvo, even a volvo salesman admitted that (i went to a saab/volvo/cad dealership to test drive a v6 9-3).

they have a lot of incentives. if you get it at the right time, you can save several thousands (usually $3000-$5000. with this economy, there may be more).

0,0,"i happen to own a 2003 bmw with 45k miles. and, coincidentally, before i bought the bmw, i had been all set to purchase a 545i sport 6-speed. the party that had the bmw on order defaulted, dealer called me and i came in with a check for full msrp that afternoon. 

the bmw certainly depreciates, but not proportionally as much as the standard v8 bmw. at least not in my (pittsburgh) area. i paid $75,800 for mine, and have been offered $38,000 in cash (not trade) by the dealer. the 545i had an msrp of $62,000 and would probably be worth around $26,000 today (rough estimate by my dealer). the big difference is that the bmw has a dedicated enthusiast following. everyone knows what it is. the 545i/550i 6-speeds are very nice car, but less than 10% of v8 buyers opt for the 6 speed. the vast majority are automatics and sold to an affluent, but not necessarily ""driving enthusiast"" demographic. that definitely makes resale a bit more of a challenge and my dealer indicated he would only take a 545/550 of any kind on a trade (would not buy for cash). 

i didn't buy the bmw with resale value being a high consideration. but i'm pretty sure that if i looked at the numbers, i'd get most of the additional $15k i spent on the bmw over the 545i back, if i decided to part with it tomorrow. but i have no interest in doing that. it still drives like the day i bought it and there really is nothing sweeter in a sedan than that hand built m engine effortlessly running up to redline or that sport suspension handling the curves almost as well as my 911 turbo.

and, to be fair, from the parents' point of view, and somewhat dependent on where you live, traffic congestion and road conditions create an environment that certainly makes me uncomfortable sending our teenagers out ""cruising."" 

i agree there are plenty of alluring car at all price levels. in fact, i think some of the most engaging vehicles are in the non-luxury, compact segment. hence, my recent ownership of a mazda, replacing a mid-size luxury car. 

unfortunately, it seems the luxury makes have started reserving the sportier, more engaging experience for the upper-end niche sport models. whereas previous models of a bmw could provide a very engaging drive (and a manual for that matter), it seems you have to step up to an bmw now to get something as dynamic. 

so, all price levels? i don't know - i think there's something missing in the middle. compacts such as my previous mazda, a honda si, subaru, the subaru, etc. are certainly engaging. but if you want to combine that with more refinement and some of the luxury trappings we enjoy, you have to step up to the other end of the spectrum. hence, my replacement of the mazda with the s4."

maybe this is old fashioned thinking.

it seems to me, if you're going to market your car with a choice of ten standard (non-custom) colors, the price should include the cost of the paint. when the customer requests a ""non-standard"" or custom color, well, whatever the traffic will allow should govern the price.

i've taken the tour through the audi factory in germany (6 times), and they are very proud of the part of the tour where you get to see the paint booth. there is a display near the paint facility that has the entire spectrum of available colors displayed as somewhat large paint chips (for the workers or the customers? to see). there were dozens of audi colors apparently able to be specified -- i would call them non-custom.

i understand that pearl swirl pink is probably not a color chosen often, ditto some fantastic purple swirl colors -- but, i assume the fact that they are ""on the wall"" means the factory just didn't make a one-off paint blend for a customer (perhaps bentley does this, but i would not imagine audi would not for $1,000, in other words.)

we're down to two (black gloss and white gloss) standard colors these days -- literally every other standard color costs extra. the audi exclusive line (should one toyota into their paint pallet) costs even more on top of that.

it just irks me to be charged for something that shouldn't be a question. silver is not a custom color, hell, even the purple infused black audi calls panther black justifies a $1,000+ optional add on. pull the other one.

i know, i know, everyone does it and seems to get away with it -- and i do assume that some paint colors cost more to fabricate than others, but couldn't these companies just bury the cost in the base price and let the customer pick what they want. this is especially annoying since most folks don't order their car, and therefore have no say. 

rare is the car on the lot that is gloss black -- the ones on the lot are pearl black or panther black or oolong black or whatever the name du jour is. but at anything over 10 feet away, they all look black and shiny.

even the ibis white (a free color) looks little, if any, different than the metallic white offered -- beyond 10 feet away.

i had no issue paying for a full-on leather interior (no alcantara, that is) for my s4, but i would have been miffed if leather was standard and yet red leather was $1,000 upcharge. god help me if i wanted the leather in a non-standard color.

i'd gladly pay for a heated steering wheel or heated rear seat -- those options weren't available. but 'cmon, black or white paint or pay up? luckily i am fine with white.

now, my wife, on the other hand, just rolls with it and says, $1,075 for the color is ok. 

i've watched the car being painted, mostly it's done by robots -- does it really cost that much extra to get one in silver?

i may have (i do have) some issues with the acura -- but many/most of them are of a cosmetic nature -- but, now that acura bought new wheels for me (3 of the 19"" wheels were bent so badly that they could not be road-force balanced), i have no issues with the steering. the wide and low profile tires that were on the audi and on this acura can be the source of some ride stiffness, but i have no issues that i can comment on that have anything to do with the electric power steering.

the tl sh-awd advance is very well equipped, smooth driving and riding, yet chevrolet and nimble (due to the wheel/tire combo and the sport suspension).

it does seem to be not an unreasonable imitation of an audi s4 when one factors in the s4's $11,000 premium when similarly contented -- if you can get past the controversial styling (yes, even the toned down 2012 still has too much ""beak"" for most folks.)

i will shop acura (among others) for my next car when the lease is up on this one -- at this point, i would shop the upcoming tlx, the infiniti infiniti, the audi audi, the bmw 3, the cadillac ats and cts and probably the volvo volvo. 

the acura suffers from not providing its owner with an experience that is not crystal-clearly differentiated from the honda upon which it is based.

i found the car hiding in a local craigslist listing. just 2 pictures and a fair asking price. i called him and after he told me about the car, i knew it was the one. when i took delivery, we posed for pictures together and he told me that if anything didn't meet my satisfaction, he'd buy it back from me. he even called me the next day to see how i liked it and to tell me he's glad that i bought it and that it went to a good home.

a day in the life

due to our on-again, off-again “hobby” – getting educated about a somewhat eclectic number of automotive brands – my wife and i have had the experience of visiting dealerships and interacting with many current auto models and their sales representatives. included in this list: jeep, chrysler, gmc and, of course, cadillac. of course we’ve also experienced acura, audi, bmw, infiniti, lexus, mercedes-benz benz and volvo, too. but, in response to denysschen’s “warning” to gm’s top brass, i can now reflect on what seems to be a different “approach” prospective customers will enjoy when shopping at the dealership of, apparently most, american automotive brands.

have you ever heard of or seen a tv show called “wkrp in cincinnati?” if so, you will have a somewhat more well-rounded perspective of the herb tarlek approach. i want to make sure you understand my remarks are a caricature – an exaggeration. you see, mr. tarlek is the sales manager of the fictional cincinnati radio station wkrp – and he is, well, terrible. his behavior qualifies him to be called either a jerk or a jackass. his behavior and customer’s interactions with him often seem vaguely slimy, borderline unethical and disreputable. further, it appears that mr. tarlek has a problem with women, often calling them “hon’” and usually ignoring them altogether, if they are with a man.

pulling into the lot of [even] a cadillac dealership, the gentleman sporting a white belt and white shoes barely allows customers to exit their vehicles before invading their personal space and asking them if their “time-frame” is today (since he’s already below his quota and needs to only spend time with customers who will sign and drive now.)

then, you are guided to – apparently – the vehicle with the spiffs on it and “encouraged” to take a test drive. you are required to allow your driver’s license to be photocopied and you may even have to produce proof of insurance. then, the rep gets into the back seat in order to answer any questions that may arise during the test drive.

and so it goes – you can’t wait to get out of there, for, during the test drive the chatter from the back seat is incessant, pressing you for “what’ll it take” to get you to close the deal today.

come to think of it, this isn’t as much of a caricature as i had intended.

i don’t know if these dealer reps ever shop for car anywhere else to “see how it is done elsewhere,” but the evidence suggests this is not the case.

on top of way too many dealers, denysschen has his work cut out for him – i suspect he’ll be incredibly popular with the dealers (uh huh).

unless i knew exactly what i wanted and could pretty much handle the entire transaction over the internet, i don’t know why folks willing and able to plunk down sums often way north of $50,000 put up with this kind of behavior – oh wait, apparently not enough of them do.

swallow your pride and see if there’s any openings at audi, mr. denysschen. cadillac may just be, if not a lost cause, in possession of too much inertia."

some drivers seem to really like the zf transmission for this reason, but others really don't. some people seem to have jerky and ""hunt for the gear"" shifting issues at low speeds.

0,0,"""the rwd line is still more fun for me.""

in my experience, driving the ""rwd line"" in a fwd car gives you abundant understeer as you try to apply power while cornering. you can't accelerate and turn in a fwd car like you can with rwd, so the key to fast lap times with fwd is to keep the steering wheel pointed straight as long as possible through the corner (imagine the peak of a triangle superimposed over the corner to illustrate minimal time spent turning). the entry side of the triangle is longer and bends deeper into the corner because you're (trail)braking (more traction in front and even some oversteer in a more neutral fwd car). the exit side of the triangle is shorter and arrow straight so you can get on the gas sooner and harder.

material quality in the tlx is a lot better than even in this generation of honda. here's one example that stood out for me. the dial on the steering wheel of the new honda is clearly copied from the acura, but it's cheap feeling, and the movement isn't particularly refined. on the acura this control is really great in term of feel and ease of use. they look almost the same, but big difference in feel and operation. you can find differences like that in a dozen or more things just on the inside.

there's more room in the back seat and in the trunk of the honda, but in most other ways the tlx is better and nicer.

white and gloss black are often the only two ""free"" paint colors offered by european mfgrs. my wife pulled the trigger on a $1,075 paint color called panther black -- yes it is purty, but that just seems like way too much for what appears black from a distance of over 10 feet.

i used to special order pearl white on all my audis. then, one year, the price jumped from $500 to $2,500 and pearl white became a member of the special order collection that audi offers to anyone who will hyundai up the money. it is called audi exclusive -- hell yes it is exclusive, because anything you order -- anything -- starts at $2,500 -- why? because they can. 

in 2009, i wanted the ecru (cardamom) interior color and it only came with blonde wood -- i thought the contrast wasn't there, i wanted the burl walnut wood inlays. at that time, $2,000. despite the fact that i had custom ordered the audi pretige with most every option listed, i just couldn't bring myself to pay $2k for something that was no charge had i not wanted the cardamom leather. next year blonde was dropped in favor of the dark walnut. 

much as i favor an almost the sky's the limit, i just can't see something like i have just described as anything other than an option from our ""shameless profit collection.""

bmw seems to charge breathtaking prices for wheels that aren't part of the two or three ""normal"" choices offered -- i know there are certainly differences that justify higher costs, but there was an x6 on the showroom floor with a $5,000 wheel package (tires were another upcharge). 

i know a lot of options are outrageously priced, but at least it would seem they kind of bury the charge so that the price gouging isn't obvious.

now i'll show my ignorance -- the last time i priced an infiniti, their color palate was ""included"" in the msrp base. this included both pearl and just clearcoat colors. 

i'm the guy who would probably pay more for the basic car if all the paint choices were ""included"" -- it just galls me to see $1,075 for an admittedly pretty black color. it is good that i actually prefer white, cause were they to start charging extra for gloss white, i'm sure i'd scream ""i'm mad as hell and i'm not gonna take it anymore!""

this was the day i test drove an audi s4 and the tl sh-awd advance.

the cadillac was the least desirable of the three -- if one had any lust for even a hint of performance. the 3.6 engine seemed enthusastic in its sounds and refinement but was unable to press you back in the seat at full throttle. the feeling in the cts was ""same day service."" 

the cts lacked the driver and passenger above-door handles that even the least expensive volkswagen's offer -- and it's not like passengers would have no use for them. this symbolically told me where cadillac's head was, and that is cadillac's head is up its nose!

now, for the money (not msrp, lease money per month, that is) the pecking order (from low payment to high) was acura tl sh-awd advance, cadillac cts/4 premium luxury and the s4 (prestige). at these respective levels of trim each of the three offered about the same content (although the cadillac didn't have blind spot monitoring which seems like a glaring oversight.)

if acura is trying to compete with infiniti, i know of none of their car that offers the performance level, interior poshness or hp for the buck offered by infiniti. 

i do like my acura (which is $547/mo for 36 months) -- i am not crazy about the styling (exterior) and there is very little ""premium"" anything in the interior except the heated and ventilated seat -- the 2012 acura does a decent impression of my 2005 audi audi (which had the +sized wheels and tires, but no sport suspension, but w/sport seat) -- and the sh-awd allows the tl to perform ""similarly"" to an audi s4 (s4-lite, i.e.)

rumors are rumors and who knows what is real -- so i am planning on keeping my mind open about a 2014 tlx, cadillac ats/4, audi a? and both the g and m infiniti's.

i am looking for my next car to have what appears to be the reliability and durability of my '12 acura and my wife's '11 infiniti (and the performance of at least an audi audi in terms of handling.) the audi may have to be removed from my list, in fact, due to my suspicions that virtually any german car on the market (and i have had 29 of them) shows and feels its age more quickly than the japanese (and maybe even than the cadillac, i have no experience with that.)

i priced out an ats/4 with the turbo four and premium pack -- it turned out to be just south of $50k -- with a 6 speed auto. word is there will be an 8-speed auto ""soon."" might be worth a look-see.

if the greatest gripe i have is that the lesser tl's have no place on either the ellps or lps boards, but that the top o' the line sh-awd version is decent -- well, i think we all are in pretty good shape with any of these vehicles if configured to match one's proclivities.

the best car for you would be a white 2009 pontiac pontiac.(the other colors are ""meh"" and most women want that pearlescent white) good reliability, low price, handles very well. overall a great deal for the money that unfortunately gm in its idiocy decided to stop selling. 

i drove one and it was about 80% as nice as the previous generation cts, which is what i'd probably have otherwise recommend. but the fact that you want midsize over luxury and are considering the mazda 6, plus the g35 means a few years old or certified is also in the consideration... (i get a $25k new/used price range, right?)

it really was an eye-opener. gm as usual, has their second best car aside from the new cts not for sale in the u.s. it's still sold in australia, and is the #1 car there. 

be sure to get the premium audio but not the nav, since that radio/information center is incredible and nav systems are a waste of money.(just get a portable model for $300) one look at the radio and you'll see that it's the best radio/information center gm has ever built. 

note - the 2007 cts is also an absolute steal. as the last year of the previous style, it has few reliability issues, looks and handles great, and well, it's under $20k for a certified example. there's probably no better used deal right now that i can think of, especially since in three months, off-lease models will start to appear.(4 years old is the sweet spot for certified/off-lease executive type car)

no reason to buy now, though. wait until the 2011 models come out and the used prices go down by several thousand dollars.

this is the v8 model - crazy fun. basically a chevrolet family sedan. yes, it does get ~25mpg highway as well in actual driving.

expect $20k prices all over town on similar 2009 models in 3 months when they turn two years old.(or 15-16k on a 2008) the v6 is about 2mpg better overall and has 256 hp. it's basically as fast and nearly as chevrolet as the current base model cts. i found it to be very fast and nearly perfect. but the v8 sound... yeah, i'd sacrifice 2mpg for that... :shades:"

it's not just that. it seems they are repackaging things. it still depends on the prices, but i actually like some of the moves - 340 (more hp, so they can bump up the number) gets premium package standard, which is how it should be - i just hope the price differential between 328 and 340 won't get prohibitive. they get sport line aesthetic features standard into 328 (seat!!!!), saddle brown now available across the board. there will also be track package, not really my thing, by i understand why some will go for it. i bet they'll still keep the sport suspension away from x-drive, unless you get the ""adaptive"" option. 

i like the changes. i have no illusions on pricing, it will go up, but at least so will content. this is a typical mid-cycle refresh that adds value to a model. i'm sure bmw gc will get it, too at some point, hopefully also in 2016, perhaps just a few months later. it will be between 440 gc and 328 wagon (i'm sure there is no 340 wagon coming). i bought my current as last year of the model, where some optional things were added to increase the appeal. seems similar thing is happening again. the option schemes and packages was one of things i didn't care for in the new model. now they gave me a reason to wait."

your story is interesting, thanks for that. this is exactly the market segment that i am interested in. i had a '98 audi, and i'm currently driving an '05 tl. if i were to replace that car today, a lot of the vehicles that you listed would be on my list. my thoughts:

is - don't particularly like lexus or toyota, this one is out
acura - i really liked the previous model, i sort of agree on the current one. not as attractive, gotten too big, too soft and bloated. but a good value choice.
audi - is now too expensive. no 6 cyl choice.
bmw - the 3 series is close, but bmw's have never quite done it for me. i guess i want a little higher mix of luxury and a bit more reasonable purchase price.
cts - i don't mind the looks, i'll take your word on the interior. i'm just not quite ready to buy gm - need to see longer term reliability and survivability of the company.
volvo - i really like the looks, although i haven't sat in it or driven it. i'm shocked at how much it costs. also not sure how the ownership changes of volvo might affect things long term.
mercedes-benz benz - too expensive. also not sure i'm ready to have the mb stigma (how it looks to others). but given that, i think the mercedes-benz benz is by far the most attractive car in the class. given your comments on the interior, i have no doubt that this would be good as well. i think i'd consider getting a 2-3 yo one coming off a lease to save some money. and i think this is the one i'd eventually go to if i was going to leave my tl. it would have to be worth it, and the other car on the list just aren't quite appealing enough at this time."

i'm still driving the acura and i'm at 133k, with almost zero problem. the acura is technologically superior to the audi. the interior features are better although i felt the luxury quality of the audi interior was superior (but the acura is still quite good). in driving qualities there was no comparison - the acura is a nice chrysler; the audi was a fabulous car to drive stick, much more chevrolet, and it was as smooth as butter.

he pulled it out of the showroom and off we went. again, it wasn't very fast (especially given that it was supposed to be a sports sedan), but it showed quality and smoothness i had never experienced before.

0,0,"dino...couldn't agree more. the subsidized financing is what allows manufacturers to sell more and more car, which masking the price increases.

i can see my own automotive trend over the years. i always put a budget on what i'd pay for a car, based on what i could afford. first, (probably in the late '80s when i bought my first new car) it was $30k. that amount would net me a very nice car.

in the late '90s it balooned to $40k. 

now, i'm well into the $50k budget.

however, i expect more now than i did when i bought my first car, too. back then, all i wanted was a comfortable, reliable car (which meant a honda or a toyota). now, i want performance. i want luxury. i want reliability. i want all the tech stuff. i want the state of the art suspensions and transmissions. i want good build quality. i want top notch materials. i want styling. i want good fuel efficency. all that costs something.

that leads me to the most recent car i've had....bmw, audi, acura.

some embody those traits better than others. as of right now, i'm understanding what something like a tl has that i've missed from the german marks. of course, you won't win many drag races with a tl like you will with an s4, either.

i'm betting that at some point, with the 3 series at least, the acuras and the lexi will be able to make another inroad to the german territory (as they did in the '80s) given the price deltas and the softening of the 3."
0,0,"i have found faults with the new cts. for the most part, these faults would not rule the new cts out. the thing is, to my eye, beautiful and seemingly well made (fit and finish wise, at least.)

i think it is an sts killer and if that does come true, it will probably enter the lps class. it is, at this moment in time, still a ""near"" lps contestant. not because i say so, heck it is virtually in the class now by most ""measurable"" accounts (content wise.)

it is not the most modern, it breaks very little new ground (if any) in the ellps or lps class -- other than its styling. when compared with the lps class it comes out as a bargain, when compared with the class ""the pundits"" place it in, however, it is about 15% or so too pricey.

i do not think it is cadillac's phaeton -- indeed, i think it will be thought of as the beginning of a new cadillac. it will find itself -- if it is forced to play in the lps class -- the bargain car.

that may not be enough.

i would compare the new cts with the bmw 3, the new (not in the us yet) audi and perhaps an infiniti or lexus of the tweener variety as you suggest.

now, for me, the interior and the 300+ hp motor are winners -- and knowing gm, the lease incentives will start second quarter '08 and make the new cts hard to resist for many of us who have ""been there done that"" with similar sized car from europe. my audi is lovely to behold, but breathtakingly expensive to ""hold"" beyond the warranty period.

""all"" my friends say their experience with 'merican car and trucks have typically been experiences with reliability and longentivity, if not the last 1/10th of performance.

this might be quite refreshing.

as a fur instance: my wife's bmw's brakes (when they need repair) if the thing is out of warranty cost $950 per axle -- i hear they go out about 55k miles. 

i can only assume the gm product would be friendlier to keep longer.

moreover, despite my comments about the cadillac being state of the art, 2004, well, that's not entirely a bad place to be.

the act of putting money down on a lease has absolutely no indication as to whether the person can afford it or not. it may indicate that they either don't understand the advantages of not putting money down or they just want a little smaller monthly payment. i don't think anyone should assume that just because they may prefer a smaller payment that they ""cant afford it"". it's kind of like the old saying that people that can't afford to buy the car will lease it. kind of like how you took affront when, because of your screenname, people assumed you were female. 

they could very well be much better off than you, the one accusing them of not being able to afford one of these car. making blanket statements like that is silly and very condescending!

0,0,"my best friend's wife is a police woman in one of the burgs near me. i asked her about this topic last night. while she says she's pretty good at guessing the speed of car by sight, the trick is to have evidence to use in court (which her ""guesstimate"" of speed is not). so, the radar/laser detector provides that.

most modern radar detectors will ""sniff out"" a radar source in over a mile, which can't be seen by the radar operator. laser is ""instant on"" (as is some radar devices). the officer has to be relatively close to the vehicle to get their reading (100 yards or so). 

she said if there's heavy traffic, you won't know if the officer is ""pinging"" you or someone else. but, your laser detector will go off and on in short bursts, full laser detection to none in quick succession (telling you that the officer is taking a speed reading of several car.

she also said that she has to get a lock on your vehicle, of a reflective surface (usually the license plate) and that curvy roads in high traffic areas are the easiest for a ""perp"" to get away with speeding/using a detector.

finally, she mentioned that the time to look for radar/laser, especially ""instant on"" is when you're traveling on roads that offer ""cover"" for a police vehicle to spy on you....a thicket of trees, a valley in the median, an overpass (which she uses with another officer on the road. 

she also said laser guns are way more expensive, and are harder to use, than radar guns. thus, there are many, many more radar set ups than laser as municipalities can't understand why the same number of tickets (revenue generators) can't be used instead of the more expensive laser guns."

plus you have to keep a car older than 5 years, otherwise you are always making payments. though overall the payments should be lower (since the car is cheaper) but that can actually cancel out if you trade every 3 years."

0,0,"subaru has 4 different awd setups but they have fundamental similarities. the boxer setup allows for a center mounted trans eliminating uneven axles to create a balanced system for each side of the car, eliminating torque steer. they also have a 50/50 (or very close to it) depending on the system that is being used (torsen based), where as other systems are fwd car that send small amounts of power to the rear wheels if needed (haldex based).
with audi, they have two different kinds of setups, one being haldex based the other being torsen based. it depends on which type of motor being used in the car if it is the inline four in the 2.0t or a vr6 configuration like the 3.2 or 2.8 car it's a haldex based system, if it uses a true v6 or a v8 then it gets the torsen based system and is rear biased in power split.
most companies use the haldex based awd i.e. toyota, honda, ford, etc. that system is not as effective since it doesn't have as much power going to each wheel when it needs it. if you are driving on ice, or snow, or in the rain it helps to have the power going to those wheels, with subaru you have the car shifting around power as well, creating a system that is unmatched by most systems, audi is in a close second with its audi system when using the torsen system."

0,0,"for those of you who are also on ccba & sftsf, this is a re-post:

as you all know, my current dd is a 2011 bmw 328xia which i am madly in love with. today i had to bring my car in for service (trunk latch, adaptive headlight, & battery cable recall) and was provided a loaner car to drive. i've had a fantastic experience with 2 previous loaner car, a 2011 bmw & a 2013 x1 28i. today's loaner car write up is on the 2013 bmw f30 328xia sedan. 

i sit down in the car, adjust the seat & the mirrors, look for a place to stick the key (it's keyless go dummy!), put my foot on the brake, push the start button, tap the car into drive and i'm ready to roll. the 4cyl n20 turbocharged engine is most definitely nowhere nearly as smooth as my car's inline 6 and kind of clatters like a diesel at idle. 

the 1st thing i notice is the the new f30 is bigger than my e90. bigger trunk, bigger back seat, more headroom, wider center console. bigger, but not as comfortable. the new center console is wider and my right leg is not comfortable resting up against it. 

the seat are nice and firm. even though they are no sport seat, they have thicker bolsters than my car. i notice the buttons on the dash board are located much higher than they are in my car. the screen is smaller and i look down at the i-drive controller and realize that this car doesn't have navigation. no big deal, but the smaller screen looks like an afterthought. the steering wheel is bigger and is not as thick as the steering wheel in my car. dash & interior materials are high quality. 

navigating my way out of the dealership's back lot, i notice the featherlight steering. i stop a minute after starting the car to adjust my seat some more and the car shuts off. what? oh, auto stop/start. take your foot off of the brake or tug the steering wheel and the car fires right back up instantaneously. 

right out of the dealership i notice how vague the steering response is and how soft the suspension is tuned. a few traffic lights later and i notice the ""drive mode"" button. i figure out the car is in ""eco-pro"" mode and toggle is forward 2 notches until it says ""you are now in sport mode."" now we are getting somewhere. i notice the steering tightens up to an acceptable level and throttle response is instantaneous. i can't give it a full nail the gas and merge test because there is just too much traffic. 

once i'm on the highway, i figure i'll just toggle back down to ""eco-pro"" mode to see what kind of mpgs this baby can return. the car wallows, is unresponsive, and provides the same steering ""feel"" as a 1991 oldsmobile custom chrysler station wagon. this lasts for approximately 25 seconds. i think to myself: ""what are they kidding me?"" 

i toggle back into ""sport"" mode and notice the same thing that happened before, except now the 8 speed automatic shifts into 6th and won't go any higher, even though i'm cruising. toggling the car into ""toyota"" mode dials back on the throttle response and steering weight. plus the car will shift into 8th gear. but now the car is not as tight. 

pay the toll, dial up ""sport"" mode and mash the gas on the way out. the 8 speed autobox shifts crisply and the motor rockets the car forward. the engine and transmission are paired perfectly. you can tell they were designed together. 

so now ""sport"" is the way to make the car drive decent. so in order to keep the revs down, select ""sport,"" slide the beer tap shifter to the left, and ""manually"" shift into 8th gear. 

hit a decent amount of ""bad weather"" traffic once i hit the ct border. the brakes don't seem as strong as my e90, there seems to be a bit of pedal float until the brakes bite, and i can actually feel the car dive under semi hard braking. 

while i was cruising, the trip computer said i was consuming fuel at a rate of 32 mpg. even with the traffic, the car still returned 30.5 mpg. good fuel economy numbers are nice, but that's not the main reason you buy ""the ultimate driving machine."""

0,0,"i like the v8 dodge a lot, thanks. no issues at almost 4,000 miles.

there is certainly much to like about the s3, for me. 
however, the price is quite high when well equipped, 
to me \ from my point of view.

for example: 
although the motor is certainly a very good 4 cylinder, it is still a 4 cylinder – and does not really make the sort of sounds i associate with the price point. ultimate acceleration is certainly acceptable, but i prefer more immediate torque delivery from low rpm. it does pull well, once rpm & boost climb. the dct & final drive gearing requires much, much higher rpm in top gear at cruising speeds than i prefer.

the interior rear view mirror is absurdly small.

the sunroof has only a mesh cover \ sunshade – not a solid one. here in hotlanta, that is really not a good idea. . .

although handling inspired confidence, i agree regarding the ride quality. part of that may also be the s3’s relatively short wheelbase.

the interior materials seemed appropriately high quality, and the seat were comfortable and supportive. with full leather seating, i do appreciate the fact that cooling is available for those seat in the dodge – and it works really well! 

i liked the fact that the s3’s center armrest adjusts up\down & fore\aft – a nice touch. i do prefer the nav screen being in the dash, instead of popping up above it.

clearly, many of these are just a reflection of my own personal preferences.
that’s all i recall – last drove one in december.

0,0,"well, part of the reason the back seat room isn't a priority for me is because of my physical size. i'm nearly 7 feet tall, so shopping for a car is like being fitted for a suit. since most car companies don't cater to someone my size, my shopping short list ends up very short. for example, the mercedes-benz benz e class, bmw 5 series both don't have enough room for my legs and knees. the audi audi is even worse. the lexus gs doesn't have enough head room (the es is better). the only cts competitors i've driven that i fit into are the infiniti m35 and the acura rl.

one of the reasons i liked the previous cts was because it had enough leg room and knee room for me....barely enough, but it was enough. i was very afraid that the next generation car wasn't going to have enough room for me. instead, i found that the front leg room and knee room was far better than the outgoing vehicle.

0,0,"fat chance on those $40. there is no doubt bmw can get expensive at times. i don't kow prices at infininti dealers, but all other lux car (incl. lexus or mercedes-benz benz) oil changes are easy north of $100 (it's both the special grade synthetic oil and labor), so i find it unlikely infiniti would charge much less. $40 are those mineral oil changes at chevrolet, ford or toyota, not synthetic. a six pack of synthetic mobil 1 is almost $40 at costco and it may not be appropriate for your particular car. to balance, bmw has oil changes every 10-15k miles, depending on actual driving, which can balance several $40 per 3k miles changes.

btw, infiniti has lease return fees. directly from infiniti website ""disposition fee due at termination of lease"". all lease companies do, no exceptions. they may sometimes waive them if you get another car of same brand.

combining military grade power with luxury is no mean feat -- but audi has done it again with the sq5. we even test drove a cayenne (which costs more) and it didn't have the power and urge of the sq5. it seems to get this much power in a cayenne you have to resign yourself to a 6 figure purchase. we got my wife's sq5 at 6% off sticker plus $1,000 loyalty bonus.

the s car will look pretty cool sitting in the garage, too: hers is black and mine is white. 

we went ahead and got the 20"" audi oe inch wheels (it came with 21""'s which you can't get all season uhp tires in the correct size) and we had the dealer take off the stock summer only tires and replaced them with new continental extreme performance dws uhp a/s's.

driving it home for good, tonight at 6pm. can't wait.

good bye 2011 infiniti infiniti (which btw has been a very good car, but one that my wife says, ""ain't got no soul."") :surprise:

i must have something wrong with me -- for i use my nav system every day, every single day. i leave for work in the am and i punch up my nav system, set the scale to 4 miles, which is enough to capture two interstate highways that i may have to travel.
wait 5 seconds.
the screen paints a series of red, yellow or green outlines along either the north/south or east/west route that i must travel to get from sub-urban cincinnati to the cbd (where i need to be). if i see too much red painted on the interstates (275 or 71), i know things are gonna be s=l=o=w so i take a secondary road route -- and i often try multiple routes and ask the navi lady to help me.
i also ask the system to give me an approximate arrival time.
hell, i play with all this stuff and wish there was more tech to assist me in my dodge.
to each his / her own -- but the thing is, increasingly, the buyers of ellps's and lps's take for granted that their vehicles will come with nav and a lot of other driver aids.
i was in a meeting in lexington ky (80 miles south of cincinnati) the other day -- we were discussing an upcoming meeting and the client made the assumption that i would just input the address into the car's nav system (he knew not anything about my car), so he didn't give me directions, he just gave me the street and number of the destination to plug into my nav.
a garmin certainly works fine, folks often say they are superior to the factory systems (other than not being integrated with the rest of the car's ""avionics"".) it is just a preference (of mine) to have everything built in.
hence my frequent close: drive it like you live. i submit, however, that all of this tech will soon, soon, soon be standard and that there will be a bunch of new tech none of us have even imagined, yet.

the tl gets what i consider low mileage, the s4 has 10% more power and 10% better gas mileage to boot. that's probably due to the tl being about 250 lbs. heavier and it is bigger with more leg room, as well as not having a 7th gear like the audi (nor the efficient dual clutch system). 

i do think the new tl's are improved in the looks department, but the styling still leaves me thinking ""plain jane."" the s4 is a truly beautiful car, and has what appears to me to be a paint job a few notches higher in quality. the s4 offers some color selection (not much) while the tl offers almost none (white black, and shades in between, along with an ugly purple they call red).

frankly, edmund's tmv puts the tl at $39,500 with the awd and tech package. i've looked at all the details, and frankly, acura in my view should have priced it at $37,000. they did take some shortcuts....

for instance, the roof rails are not body colored . 

also, the 3.7 from nissan/inifiniti have about 330 hp, why not acura's? 

the base fwd tl costs $4k more than the honda honda v6 and for that you get 2 added hp, 2 less mpg, and a somewhat nicer interior. just throwing that in there for anyone considering a fwd tl.

as nice as the tl-tech interior is, the s4's is better. i compared a base tl-awd w/ the tech package, and the tech package has nicer perforated leather than the base model, but the s4's nappa leather was still clearly superior to both (softer and nicer). yes, i know the nappa isn't standard."
0,0,"wonder what the % of manual transmissions delivered to customers is (and if there is any historical comparison available, what that might be)?

my wife and i purchased car with manual transmissions up until 2005 when -- the car that we wanted -- basically stopped being offered with manuals.

i did, mostly, enjoy my first 6-speed auto (a tiptronic), but always wondered what the same car would be like with a manual. no way to tell, as a practical matter, anymore.

then, i test drove the 2014 s4 with a manual and the 7-speed dsg (dual clutch ""automatic manual"") -- i found the dsg to provide all of the good things (except the actual depressing of the pedal) of a manual, but after a back to back demo drive (of both transmissions in otherwise identical s4's) i decided the dsg actually felt quicker, and it certainly could be a hell of a lot smoother. moreover, i use the type of car washes where you give your car to ""the guy"" to drive through the tunnel, etc -- and i smelled a burning clutch and heard grinding gears one time too many, so i talked myself into the dsg.

now at some 30,000+ miles later, i find the dsg to be the best transmission experience i have ever had, relegating my love of manuals to be my sentimental favorite, but not for the performance, i used to believe could only be achieved by rowing your own.

i am fortunate to also have another audi an sq5 with an 8-speed tiptronic. oddly, despite the torque converter, this iteration of the 8-speed is also better even than an s4's manual (there is no way to back to back test the sq5 manual vs tip since audi only offers the sq5 with the 8-speed.) but the 8-speed still has a hint, a vague suggestion really of being ""almost instantaneous"" making it sort of like the coke zero of cola -- it's not diet coke, but it's not quite the real thing either.

the march forward of auto trans technology is, i would assume, largely responsible for the death and dearth of manual offerings. and, even though the dsg easily justifies its existence, i wonder if all 8-speeds are as good as the tuned version in the sq5. i would, therefore, imagine there are other reasons for the paucity of stick shifts -- the only one i can think of is convenience, unless the real reason is ""we've"" been marketed to, so convincingly, and been convinced that we've lost the manual dexterity to undertake shifting, and that we don't really need it.

i'm going to stick with convenience as the killer of the manual.

but, i would be keenly interested in knowing the percentages if such source for that data is available.

there are a lot of really good car (as good or better than bmw) at price points that are much less.
how many of them are rwd and come with a manual transmission?
at the risk of getting myself in hot water: none, since we now have numerous examples regarding performance -- stating that overall, the automatic transmission especially one with dual clutches is generally speaking (for those of us mere mortal consumers) superior and preferred by a huge number of regular consumers. only if enough folks spend the money and actually buy a manual transmission car, will they even be available too much longer. automatic transmissions today improve the performance (or at least the perception of performance) of many, if not most, of the car they are marketed with.

and, in terms of the utilization and circumstances of use by the majority of consumers (again for mere mortals), awd no longer needs to have any apologies made for it or by it, other than to say, ""excuse me"" as the awd version passes the rwd or fwd version. ask porsche, to name one, what car they market are awd -- the low performance or high performance variants?

i can appreciate rwd and manual transmissions -- but they're not, for the buyers that keep these ellps car mfgs alive and well, where the ""performance"" buyers gravitate towards.

the reasons are well documented and even if i did think rwd and manual transmissions were any more than an entry in the bibliography of a glitzy brochure (if brochures actually had bibliographies), the shoppers, buyers and actual consumers believe and behave differently (based on their spending, at least); that is auto trans car rule and awd is in very widespread use, often in the car touted as the highest performance versions.

the sooner we start recognizing that these companies that build the machines we covet probably don't care one way or another what wheels are driven and how the thing is shifted, the better, because they care overwhelmingly what will facilitate the goals of corporate survival, growth and prosperity. i would assume if bmw thought it could overwhelm audi by building and selling fwd car exclusively with manual transmissions, i would assume they would do so. 

a dead purist is still dead, after all. companies are no different -- the auto transmission has or is close to defeating stick shifts; turbo or super or both engines of 4 or 6 cylinders are replacing displacement based engines as each day passes and awd car or at least the option to add awd is well on its way toward total market dominance.

i like being alive -- but, in my case at least, i actually think auto trans awd vehicles are the best most of us mere mortals can get today. so i think i am a purist, just one who thinks rwd (or fwd) and stick shifts are so 1980."

you ever have an inexplicable car desire (bricklin, delorean, subaru svx)? mine appears to be the xlr. i think it's the ht convertible, just a gadget that has always appealed to me. and overall i like the exterior style of the xlr. of course, i don't like some of the gm-cheapness e.g. the plastic looking grille and, well, the interior. indeed the issue for me (and i'll assume many potential xlr buyers) is the price. even a couple of years used, the asking prices compare to some formidable new car, e.g. aforementioned chevrolet, audi a/s5 and bmw 3, jag xf among others...

0,0,"dino - i guess i should add, too, that i don't actually know that the japanese lps brands have previously been humbled, either -- but i think (my opinion) they have, or at least they should be since they so frequently are not the winner in comparos in the big, important car magazines.

i saw motorweek on tv this week and the lexus gs was tested (not compared), things went along nicely as the car was shown on the track and street -- and then wham! john davis pretty much put the car in its place (which was to say, it was not at the top of the premium car heap, based on comments about handling, braking, etc),

yet, ""everyone"" i know who has a lexus loves them -- of course whenever i ask why, the reason, the reason, the #1 reason, the only reason i can ever get out of them, is either how reliable or durable they are. 

odd, methinks, how i can't ever seem to elicit a comment about a lexus, infiniti or acura that praises their performance, style, switchgear -- oh oh oh, i take it back, once, someone told me how good the sound system in his acura is (and speaking as a previous acura tl sh-awd advance owner, i agree -- acura has the best sound systems for mere mortals -- the only one that is better is the hyper expensive b&o option audi offers for $6,000+).

don't get me wrong, a sound system is very important in a car -- but, you know, when someone tells me about their 5 series or their new mercedes-benz benz e or c, they tell me about the performance, ergonomics, 8-speed or 7-speed transmission, engine, responsiveness, cornering, etc, etc, etc.

my wife thinks that her infiniti was great -- from a durability (and probably reliability) standpoint. but she ended up with an sq5 (audi) because ""infiniti's ain't got no soul."" she was against my getting a 2014 is 350 for the same reason -- told me, i'd be underwhelmed by it's appliance-like disposition.

i do appreciate, too, that i've read, here, the comments -- positive comments -- about the recent el and lps cadillac offerings. and, well, they are hardly known as durable car -- and no one i know who has one claims they got it thinking it would be the new world champion of longevity. ok, so here i am at age 63 -- i'm thinking i'm still gonna outlive any car i get, so i might as well get one that comes with passion, performance and pulchritude.

got one more data point for you: when i used to have the acura, i'd take it to the dealer for service and would talk to other customers about their reasons for being acura owners. now, get this -- the best answer i ever got was ""because i got a good deal."" meanwhile, over at the audi cafe (and the bmw store service area, too) the folks talk about how much fun their car are to drive.

bmw subsidizes their leases with high residual values. according to bmwfs, after 30 months my 2011 328xi will be worth $26,406 with 50k on the odometer. my car is going straight to auction and they will loose their shirt. the car will be 3 model years old (with the 2015s coming out not too long after that, so almost 4) and the old body style. 

infiniti uses low money factors. 

mercedes-benz benz uses conquest cash. 

acura uses loyalty cash & low apr. if you follow the ""prices paid"" or ""lease questions"" of any particular make/model it is apparent.

i'll be the 1st one to admit that my 2011 e90 328xi lease is a splurge for me. if it wasn't for the generous incentives ($2500 cash, sixty something percent residual value after 30 months, bmwfs makes 1st 2 payments up to $500 each) offered by bmwfs in march 2012 on leftover 2011 models, i'd still be driving my 2010 acura acura."

0,0,"the problem is that the uaw's ""job security"" essentially ties gm's hands. they want to get rid of the entire job bank and many part-timers to lower costs, but the union won't budge.

unfortunately, for gm, it's trim the workforce or shut its doors in the u.s. and move overseas. zero other options. so the uaw just effectively shot itself in the foot because gm is back against a wall with no way out.(and logically, as a result, no room to negotiate). they sucked and sucked and sucked at that teat until it just gave out.

gm's best move at this point? fire the entire uaw and hire the employees on their own terms(or hire new workers). they really have no other choice. given how our economy is going downhill, i suspect most of the workers will give in sooner or later if it's a choice between accepting less money and having their car and house payments or having their pride. the rest they can hire.

now, i'm personally a supporter of most unions, but it's a give and take scenario. i've seen the uaw do noting but take for two decades or more and it's finally made gm decide that opting out is less painful than negotiating. i don't really blame them, either."

carwoo allows you to configure the car exactly as you want it and you get a text box to explain any flexibility you may have or anything you will not consider.

you then press a button and wait about 24 hours for the carwoo email machine to start sending you links to your carwoo account with offers from dealers.

audi dealers responded, oddly, (all of them) saying they had no inventory and that any audi would have to be ordered. one of them finally gave me a price but it was for 42 months, not 36 or 39 and it began with a $7 (for a sub $48,000 audi for pity's sake).

acura, locally, came in at best, with a 6.5% discount off msrp (columbia). a columbus ohio dealer -- lindsay acura -- came in at 13% off msrp for a 2012 acura tl sh-awd advance with backup sensors (which are about a $715 accessory.) here's the funny thing, they sourced the car from columbia -- i have the window sticker! whatsupwiththat?!?

the car was $499 per month + tax.

i had driven all of the car (not a lexus or mb of any kind) multiple multiple times and really liked the audi (what's not to like i still have my 2009 for another 30 days?), the m37x and the tl sh-awd (advance model). likewise i thought the volvo volvo t6 was great fun! i also had a chance to drive a premium+ audi s4 (without the sport diff -- aka no torque vectoring.) now that car was the most fun of all (but in premium+ mode had much less ""content"" than the other car i had tested, plus is was mo' money, big time.)

truth be told in what was nearly a back to back to back experience, i drove the audi, the cadillac and the acura over the exact same route for about the exact same time, speeds, tunes on the sound system, etc, etc, in one day's worth of test drives.

i am hoping not to receive a bunch of ""are you out of your mind"" posts, but i will toyota to say this -- the acura tl sh-awd advance is very close in performance and overall ""character"" to an audi s4 -- and although very nice and perhaps ""dressier,"" the cadillac cts/4 3.6 with the 19"" wheel performance option was the least inspiring of the bunch.

now the acura tl sh-awd advance is no audi s4, i am not saying it is, the s4 would be the winner, but contented to match the acura was just shy of $12,000 more and i could not muster the one that i drove (which was not contented thusly) into and out of corners that much quicker than i could the acura (which may have had an advantage over the audi at the time since the acura had torque vectoring and the the audi did not. moreover, the audi did seem more prone to wallowing through corners as if it had more understeer than the acura, which, even though it was slower seemed perhaps better balanced than the audi.

so, i says to myself, the acura (as equipped to my tastes) was just under $48,000 (including shipping, but excluding tax), and my price was about $8,000 off of that -- thank you carwoo.com.

no one else even came close.

remember i was pricing an audi 2.0t prestige 8-spd tip w/sport package and wood which came in pretty close msrp wise to the acura. the cadillac had attractive offers but other than its glizt left me thinking it was not focussed on performance as much as the other guys. and, the cadillac had one thing missing that, for me, was a deal breaker -- a $53,000 cts does not have grab handles for the front seat passenger or driver. all the other guys do -- and i consider them essential, basic, standard, normal and required. how much do grab handles cost anyway -- in a $53,000 car, maybe $50? what were they thinking? and, moreover, cadillac in the 4-door cts does not even offer a blind spot warning system -- which came standard on both the audi and the acura at the trim levels i spec'd.

so, thus far, i am missing the audi new car smell, i miss automatic windshield wipers and bi-xenons (but i rarely can turn on my high beams, so that is not that big of a deal) -- and, oddly enough, i miss the audi needle sweep when i start the acura up.

then, i get on the highway and press my foot down, arousing a 305hp 274 pound feet of torque super smooth engine, watch the power shift from the front to the rear wheels and, zip, i'm at 80mph in a distance that seems not much longer than my driveway.

loving the cooled seat and the best sound system i have ever heard in any car (including the b&o in audi which had been my previous fave.)

having said all of this -- i probably still would have gone with the audi 2.0t prestige sport if it had come in at a price to match the acura.

money talks, as the saying goes. . . :surprise:"
0,0,"i had a rental audi (fwd, 2.0t with cvt) for about a week and half, my impression of it is: blah. 

first of all, i don't like the way cvt shifts, turbo lag is horrible, the car is floaty and has a lot of body rolls. steering is also on the light side, which makes it drives more like a japanese midsizer than an entry luxury sedan. the power is adequate enough i guess but low end torque could use a lot of improvement. audi could learn from bmw about how to reduce turbo lag. generally speaking the driving dynamic is not what i expected from a german car, even in a fwd. 

i also don't see any of the ""legendary audi interior"" in the audi. material used although is not cheap but not among the leaders in its segment. mb, bmw and lexus all utilized better materials in their own entry luxury sedan. however, the fit-and-finish is definitely among one of the best though. i believe the one i got has fake leather seat, they don't feel good when touched but is supportive and comfortable during long trips.

i guess next time i'll test drive an audi audi just to see if the experience will be different."

one can lease the bmw today at $369. let's say the 320i leases at $349. then it gives bmw the room to move the bmw to $399 a month while still offering the frugal buyers the 320i for $50 a month less."

as for the original poster's comments, yes, it took me a long time to get over the whole mercedes-benz benz stigma as well when i first owned one years ago. they are fine car and if it's any consolation to you, they carry a bit less stigma now than a typical bmw does. at least around here. 

the c 300 luxury is probably the best compromise, though, since the sport is nice and all, but the interior of the luxury is by far better. just two things, though - one, you absolutely do want to add the rear spoiler to it as it makes the back end look more defined. and the panoramic sunroof is awesome looking with the sandstone beige. (it's tinted very dark black so it adds nice contrast) it's really the only color combo that the car looks best in, imo, and i generally hate beige and tan colors. 35k all over town, so cpo at 25-30k is a snap."

i then explained that i don't like leather seating or 18"" wheels and that the mercedes-benz benz i would personally order costs $41,450. 

so, how is it on me that infiniti bundles key features within bloated and overpriced packages? they do it on purpose to force the consumer to spend thousands extra on stuff they don't want. do you think it's an accident that in order to get the sport package, you also have to order the navigation package? that's $4000 for a laundry list of stuff you probably don't need and wouldn't have ordered, but you have to swallow it if you want your infiniti to handle and stop a little better. :confuse: 

so, if i were to buy a infiniti, i would have to pass on the sport package and simply get the dodge + premium package for $39,245. that's only $2000 less than the mercedes-benz benz. every buyer has different priorities, so the numbers might be different for others, but for me, the value of the infiniti (which is it's strongest asset) has been significantly diminished.

so how did this happen? mercedes-benz benz offers the c350 with sport suspension and moonroof standard, and offers the leather and 18"" wheels a la carte. this serves the customer - if the customer doesn't want leather or 18"" wheels, they don't have to buy them. yes, if you want metallic paint on a european car, you have to pay for it, but at least you don't have to order the shiatsu massage and curb feeler packages to get it.

unless you really need awd (i.e. anticipate driving in snow on more than an occasional basis), you are paying a lot for awd. it is heavier, less fuel efficient and, depending upon how long you keep the car, prone to more expensive maintenance and repairs down the road. 

the audi quatro is a heavy pig, imo. i've been given one a couple of times as a loaner and was anxious to give it back. for all of the drooling others do over audi's interiors, i just don't get it. i like the interior and ergonomics of my 2004 tl better. on the other end, i am spoiled by my 911, which has best ""german"" style interior and seat of any car, imo.

i have not driven the is250 awd but, as has been pointed out, it would likely be highest in reliabiity, but lowest in performance and driving dynamics, if that is of any importance. plus, the rear seat is almost worth a 2+2 designation (closer to my 911 than tl in leg room)

mark.....don't disagree with any of what you have to say. if i were in the market for an suv, the audi would be at the top of the list.

that said, i tcompare the two audi dealerships in my 'burg to my bmw dealership, and there's a night and day difference with the advantage going to bmw. even when i had my acura, my preferred dealer took very good care of me.

as i mentioned previously, it might have been because i bought my s4 in chicago and am having it serviced in cincinnati. but, i really don't buy into a dealership treating you better if you buy the car from them. warranty work is paid the same regardless. and, let's face it, service work has a whole lot more margin than new car sales.

i think the training, the time spent understanding the car, the amount of time spent daily focused on customer service (or lack thereof) becomes evident in the way they take care of your problem.

your acura dealership experience would have prompted me to send a strongly worded letter to acura corporate. your car is what? a year old? and already has warped rotors? i call that a defect in materials and covered under warranty. it's not like you have 50k miles on one set of pads which are totally worn away."

some car manufacturers use a better quality leather than others. no idea about acura. 

i do know that ford uses a really poor quality leather in their lariat pickups. very poor. and i can attest that older caddys used some very good leather.

i still like the fake leather that volkswagen uses, it seems to hold up really well.
if you found a car that was a good deal and in good shape outside of the leather seat, you can certainly get new leather put in for no more than $1,500. and it's generally nicer quality than most anything that comes standard from the factory. 

now, generally, abused seat like that are simply a reflection of overall care, so it's unlikely that's the only need. 
if you pay $6 or $7 thousand for a nice clean used truck, you really don't want to spend $1,500 on seat covers. seems somehow ... disproportional. not that you're going to find many clean used trucks in that price range any more. that used to be fairly easy to do, but not any more.

my comments about the ford truck leather seat is based on my personal experiences. i have looked at quite a few used trucks, 10 or 12 years old, reasonable miles, ford and chevrolet and gmc. higher end chevrolet and gmc trucks, the leather seat were almost always in good shape. on ford, 9 out of 10 were shot, torn to h___. 

all of which is not a scientific survey, and someone else might have had exactly the opposite experience.

i will add that the king ranch ford trucks use an entirely different leather, and i have never seen a king ranch with the seat torn up."

although i had similar experiences at audi, when i asked, they didn't seem quite as anxious to volunteer the free services or wiper blades, etc. but if you asked, they gave without any indication that they were anything less than happy to do so.

one last thing, our bmw dealer requires every employee in the service department to wear white lab coats -- and you would think you were driving into a surgical theater when you went to the service dept. 

this level of service and professionalism is impressive. neither the cadillac nor the lexus dealers even come close. audi also bested the cadillac and lexus dealers, but not the bmw store.

presumably, the s4 will be longer and wider, so perhaps the size, not the hp will mitigate and dilute the temptation to cross shop. or perhaps the rs3 will be priced out of reach compared to the s4. now, then, this makes me wonder if audi may think it needs a non-avant rs4 to go up against bmw and mercedes-benz benz high zoot models (now that the rs5 is gone).

if history is repeated, the new s4 will not take a breathtaking leap up in msrp, but will take more than an evolutionary leap in content and refinement.

the issue is, car magazines (and the market itself) can latch onto the descriptor: ""long in the tooth."" i have a 2014 audi (b8) sub designated s4. i had a 2009 audi 2.0t prestige that i took delivery of in 2008. a new 2015 audi/s4 is essentially the same as a 2008 available audi. there is, far as i know, no new ordering guide for 2016 audi's available yet. 

but, this is the time of year, typically, that you can order a new audi and what will arrive is the next my. far as i know -- the operative phrase -- if you go into an audi dealer and order up a new s4 prestige with a bunch of options on it, what will arrive is a 2015 b8 version, not the eagerly anticipated b9 morphed model.

at the rate of change that is possible, it would seem to me that an 8 year model to model cycle may now be too long. no wonder the audi is selling poorly -- at this price point, folks want the next, not the current, especially if the current is, literally, 8 years old, no matter how effective the mid-cycle refresh has been.

now, i have had my 2014 about a year and a half. i have 25k miles on it. i love this car. i am thinking about replacing the tires thus enjoying the car for the next 35k miles with improved shoes.

i am hoping on a major evolution in the audi model line as it goes from b8 to b9, and i guess the thing to do is to get the new version within the first 2 or 3 my's into the -- apparent -- 8 year cycle.

i assume my current s4's durability is not in question -- thus far it has been bullet proof. i will be having the car ""rejuvinated"" at a local detail shop next week. i an assuming this process will do what the name suggests. and, i am looking forward to keeping the car beyond the end of its lease term.

subsequently, i plan -- plans are nothing, planning is everything -- to buy the next time out, but who knows, things may change. yet, i still assume i will have to order the car to my specs, but there's the fun, it's like getting a new car twice within 90 days.

and, btw, someone wrote that car on the lot are less expensive than ordered car -- i guess there are exceptions to every ""rule"" -- but in my experience an ordered car is typically hundreds less than a car on the lot; and i've never had a dealer or dealer sales rep indicate anything other than a great willingness to take an order. my rep says he would be fine -- financially, i assume -- if everyone ordered and used the dealership for test drives; this way, he says, he could have more variety available for prospects to test drive.

so to catch you up on the driving from yesterday, we left salzburg to go to lake hallstatt, what a place, and the tourist love it. it's also home to one of the biggest salt mines in austria. the drive there was about 2 hours, nothing to really report, ate lunch hung around and left, about 2pm. now this is where it gets weird, we i put the info into the nav system to get us to ljubljana, solvenia i told it not to take toll road or highway. this was a big mistake. the nav system said it was about 200 km away, and said we would arrive about 6pm, about two hours into the drive i noticed the time to arrive keep getting longer, i went back into the nav system and saw what was chosen as the route all ""b"" roads.. i fixed this but we were so far buried into the alps it didn't matter, we saw some great places, then we came upon a accident. after sitting for about 30 minutes, one of the fireman came up and told us we can wait 2-3 hours before it is cleared or we can turn around and take the ""detour"", when i asked him about this detour he couldn't answer the question, mind you the nav gave us an alternate routes but we had to go forward about 20km before they took effect (that wasn't going to work.) so we turned around and followed people who were just as lost, but they spoke german. we got a gas station and asked someone there, they gave us direction and found the detour,once we got half way through the detour we turn the nav back on and found us a route to get moving. but this route, routed us over the alps, we hit the highest point of 1765 meters (close to 6k ft) we finally got into slovenia, and arrived at are hotel about 815pm, about 2 hours later then we wanted.. ljubljana is a wonderful honda, we hit the town about 845 for dinner, we were supised on how many people were walking about, we were by the river that splints the honda in town. lots of history there and we both want to go back. it's a very modern honda.

salzburg has large elect bus network, but you have to see this mess all over the place.



austria, like german have a lot of lakes, this is just one of them. here we meet a daughter and father who were riding bikes from munich to lake halstatt they are on holiday..



hatchback and wagons are all over the place in germany and austria, this has to be one of the more popular models around europe, i would day 90% of them are diesels i saw many 118d or 120d's. bmw also makes this as a 3 door hatch, also the audi 5 door (the one we get) as well as the a1 is very popular, and most are oil burners. 



first real photos of the car in bright sunlight the blue look amazing..






the 3 series has a mid-life cycle for 2016, but the gt and 4 series do not get one, however, both the gt and 4 series have received some updates that the 3 series gets. first the rims, these have more of a grey tone to them less silver, also the middle consul and ac controls are different and lastly, the rear exhaust is black not silver this photo shows the rear exhaust.



the next two are in lake hallstatt, truly an amazing place.





last is a shot of a town we detoured through, got to love iphones and gps, i had no idea the name of this town, but when you take a photo with the phone it says the gps coordinates and will stamp the photo with the name later on. the name of this town is bad aussee, it was really charming. btw i don't think this town gets this many car..."

being fully aware of a new model due out within a year, i am a little hesitant on getting the outgoing one, but there's also something to getting a model with the bugs worked out. and i'm leaning toward a manual trannie, which i'm just guessing won't be available this next go around.

0,0,"as nice as the honda may be, and even including the fact that the honda is somewhat larger factored in, too, well, the tlx will offer paws and sh-awd. these features put the tlx into another performance category (and the tlx will also offer an 8-speed transmission and a ""sport tuned"" suspension.)
folks that shop for acuras do so, i think, because they don't want a honda (hence acura's efforts to distance the acura lineup from honda products as much as the corporate checkbook will tolerate).
these two car aren't really competitive [with each other] if you axed me. the new tlx, i would assume will end up being in comparison tests with the infiniti q50s awd and the lexus is350 awd, to name just two.
the infiniti and the lexus may have an initial advantage since they are -- ""foundationally"" -- based on rwd chassis. of course, i wouldn't count out the impact of the paws and sh-awd technology making for perhaps a more interesting showdown.
certainly these car will want to be included in the same sentences with a bmw 3 and even the somewhat aging audi/s4 family, but i do believe the tlx will work like crazy to position itself as the alternative vehicle (alternative to the infiniti and lexus, to be sure).
i'll end where i began, the acura tlx, perhaps for the first time in years, seems to have distanced itself more from the [honda] honda. i'll be so nutz as to suggest these two car will rarely be cross shopped (other than perhaps the base fwd tlx vs the honda).

0,0,"regarding diesels:

dino001, are there issues/circumstances that argue against diesels? i thought, here in the us, that once the fuel was cleaner and with the advent of ""ad-blue"" that the only factor arguing against diesel being widely adopted was inertia.

the message that i have bought into is that diesels -- and this means the hardware and the fuel -- produce more torque and can often achieve some 1/3 better mileage than gasoline (around here premium and diesel are often close to each other in price.) in short, i have bought into the notion that diesels can actually be fuel sipping ""hot rods."" the sq5 which is a terrific performer, is actually offered as a diesel in germany, for instance.

when my s4's tank is full the ""miles to empty"" reading is 400. i assumed this would mean it would be at least 520 to empty if i had the diesel set up that is in the german market sq5 in my s4. based on the audiusa website (which, for example offers up a 3.0t audi and a diesel audi) i assumed it would be a pretty simple calculation to estimate the asking price for an s4d (if one were to be made for the us market) and to then determine how many tankfuls until break even, etc.

that ""perception"" which i somehow seem to be reading in your post, may be part true, part myth. please elaborate -- here's why: i have been against using ""food"" to make ""gas"" since some politician, i assume, started pressing for e85 fuel; conversely, it has always seemed that diesel engines in our car could be a good bridge to a future where we actually can use less and less fossil fuel.

i read your post, however, and i wonder if i just drank some diesel flavored kool-aid some years ago.

again, please elaborate on your point about europeans being coerced and apparently tricked into adopting diesels whilst we 'mericans adopted, almost universally, gasoline.

thanks."
0,0,"being from upstate ny, i can mostly agree with the amount of awd models on the local lots, but there are still rwd models available, without having to special-order them (and they're not only base models with no options either).

as far as winter tires are concerned, granted each area has a different climate, but when you live in an area that averages over 150"" of snow per year, and when it can fall at rates of 4-6"" per hour, winter tires are a must. i lose count of how many different awd vehicles (suvs, car, etc.) that end up being buried in a roadside ditch simply because their all-seasons can't keep up with the conditions. people tend to forget that awd only helps with acceleration, but does nothing in terms of steering or stopping on slippery roads. given a choice, i'd take a vehicle with winter tires over any awd vehicle with all-season tires, no matter which set of wheels are actually attached to the drivetrain.

and iirc, there are some local dealers that actually store the winter tires/wheels for you when they're not needed, and will swap out the 3-season wheels/tires and store them in the winter months (for a fee, of course!)"

first off, they said the rear brakes were totally shot. i'm assuming the e-brake mechanism probably froze up due to road salt corosion. that, in turn, probably toasted the pads and then the rotors. not happy, but probably logical, however $500 seems a bit high to buy 2 calipers, rotors, and pads, as well as replace the parts.

the second item on the list really got me, though...both rear springs were broken...on a 30,000 mile car, that never has even seen anybody in the back seat! another $500-550 to replace them. i'm not all that familiar with bmw, does this seem normal??

whether or not a bmw coupe will need to be discounted because of the existence of the 1-series is a whole other topic, and that is where we could compare actual sale prices of other car (and, honestly, not a bad discussion, i don't think). 

absolutely spot on! how can we compare all options and trim or invoice and rebates and everything else? we can't! i don't know why some guys don't understand msrp. it's the easiest way to make a close guess on the value of a car that has yet to be released.
street prices are meaningless because a dealer in one area does volume and discounts heavily and another wants full msrp.
the 1 series has to slot under the 3 series, if it overlaps by too much then it will eat into the sales.
i know we see pretty much eye to eye on this. i don't know why some people to expect it to be an overpriced car which will not hold up in the market place at a high price point.

the 3 series will probably not compete too heavily as it's a much larger car and more luxury for more money. that is why the price has to be low on the 1 series. it won't do any good if it steals sales from the 3 series. it's supposed to add sales.

the entry-level tlx with an msrp of $33k might also be something to consider. for 3k more than an honda honda it offers some significant things above an honda in terms of the steering, transmission, brakes, interior design and quality, etc. although i've gotten somewhat used to the style of the new 2018 honda, i still think the tlx looks better from every angle. 

the audi is also a very nice design, and the audi is maybe the best-looking entry-level luxury car right now imho. the tlx is close, but i do think that the acura calipers on the front grill are maybe a bit too large, like it's trying a little too hard? i'm getting used to it, but i think the styling details on the audi are very nice. 

i guess the real bargain for leasing when it comes to entry-level luxury car is the acura, which is basically the fanciest and most powerful 2015 honda ever. still, with a lease price of c. $200 a month it's a good deal for the money. it's close to the same price as leasing a honda.

your 2013 honda ex might be worth c. $11-12k at trade-in, which obviously means that you have a big downpayment. would you lean toward leasing or buying?

0,0,"my issue is bmw is not nearly as luxurious inside, especially in their base trims, as say audi or mb. wood inlays really improve the look, also some of those touches you get with those lux, sport or m-line packages. the base aluminum trim is quite dull, if you ask me. their dashboard consoles always look like a 1980s recycle, the competition is light years ahead in styling of the dials and gauges, or center area. it was allright when bmw was the true athlete of the bunch, one took it because the looks didn't count, it was the driving. however, when the steering disaster of those f-coded models took hold, suddenly i ask myself, why would i pay 5 extra grand for this (of course once it is time for my current car to go). so far the only way i see bmw winning me over is by those ""peripheral"" models like gt, wagon, or perhaps x1, or x3. i find it easy to imagine that those are still sportiest of their peers. nobody else makes proper wagons anymo, i.e. sedan from hood to center pillar, extended back, no stupid raised suspensions, body claddings or other crossover crap. i believe acura will be gone soon, so the new 328 wagon may be still in the mix just because there is nothing else left, unless new cts will still feature wagon. 335 gt could have been a good alternative - killer engine, great space arrangement, but from early reports the steering and suspension are even more vague and soft than sedan/wagon. but is there anything like that around? the rest is the crossover stuff. if i did cross over, indeed, perhaps audi allroad - never tried that one. honda honda or subaru subaru, if i wanted to save some money. but it's not the same thing than proper sporty wagon. those are practically dead. 

for now i'm committed to hold onto my 328 wagon. just love that thing, 18 months after delivery it's near perfect, not to jinx it. only some major failures could make me unlove it. i'm not scared of normal maintenance or even occasional repairs. even couple of grand a year after warranty is not a big deal to me - at all. we shall see in three years how it holds."

0,0,"is there anyplace (on the web?) where the number of fwd vs audi audis sold in the us can be found? i've been to audi dealers in dallas and there were no fwd car other than a tt and the previous model audi on the lot -- awd appears not to be a regional issue. the highest performance porsches and lambos (and even some other italian exotics) are awd are they not?
i know that i am an audi-biased and even german car-biased person, but i would really like to know if there are any significant number (%) of fwd audis of any configuration sold in the us -- something (maybe emotion) tells me the number of fwd a4s, 6s. 8s, etc sold are in the single digits (%). i think it would be difficult for audi to have achieved -- after decades and the unintended acceleration setback -- premium status if the car were in any significant volume fwd. this fwd issue is a problem for acura.
in the ""old days"" you needed to at least have one v8 in your lineup to be considered premium; these days volumetric efficiency seems to have become an acceptable alternative to displacement, but there are premium class identifiers that acura seemed, for a time, to embrace and recently they seem to eschew.
they may very well be reliable and durable, but they need to be more difficult to be distinguished from their more humble honda roots. audis, for years, were often said to be ""higher cost volkswagen's"" -- an audi (called an audi 4000 on this side of the atlantic) was somewhat of a hard sell compared to a volkswagen (called a quantum) when the quantum had an audi 5 cylinder while the audi had to settle for a four-cylinder. only when audi decided to de-volkswagen its car did it begin to get the respect and pricing power to be in the premium class.
acura has (until today, hopefully) had way too much honda in their car -- placing them at the same place audi was about 20 years ago.
it's time for acura to get serious, eschewing fwd in the tlx would be a good start-- acura needs to piss or get off the pot, in crude terms, to be blunt.

oddly, my acura offers me more involvement with the car than today's bmw -- diy-friendly owners' manual, nice manual transmission, real tires (with a spare) and a dipstick.

nowdays it's necessary to have your bmw flatbedded to the dealer to get the battery replaced. that's kind of a big deal here in az where summer battery failure is a fairly regular occurrence. granted, the battery's in the trunk and is unlikely to pack up for the person who leased the car, but my last car was like that and it required two battery replacements during the time i owned it. both were performed by me where the car sat when it wouldn't start.

in fact, i remember renting a couple of nissan one time and hated them. i later bought a 1996 nissan. based on my rental car experiences i never should have even considered a nissan. but based on a lot of very postive reviews of the nissan it peaked my interest and i rented one from a dealer for three days and drove it extensively with the soul purpose of evaluation. ended up buying a loaded nissan and loved it. it was a great car that really was in another league compared to the models that i had got for rental car. it rode and handled great with plenty of pep and enough luxury for me at the time. just proved to me that renting something in the brand didn't necessarily give me a good picture of all the models and how different they can be. even now a nissan is nearly infiniti like while the nissan and others are, well, like nissan."

the only way to make up the price difference is to hold on to the car and drive the wheels off it. currently diesel in phoenix is .40 cents less than premium. do i expect it to stay like this, no, but the price fluxuates enough that it doesn't bother me. i have owned three diesel car/trucks in my past 1986 mb sdl, and 1981 chevrolet chevrolet diesel and 1996 dodge truck 2500 with the cummins diesel.. both car were driven well into the 200k miles range the truck 175k before it was sold.. the modern diesels have taken care of the short comings of those diesels.

0,0,"i had a 2005 audi 3.2 -- it was torsen. as far as i know, all [audi] audi's that use a ""north south"" engine (longitudinal) are equipped with a torsen system, not haldex. audi tt's and some audi models (and volkswagen golfs) had east west engines and utilized haldex mechanisms.

early audis with the torsen system were 50 50 torque split, haldex systems were typically 90 10 (f r) splits.

in the us, at least, almost all audis sold for the past couple of decades have been quattros and almost all of them have been torsen, culminating in the car using torsen having a rear biased awd design. the sport differential (rear only) further enabled audis so equipped to mitigate the understeer prevalent in car (like audis) with their engines ahead of the front axle. 

torsen awd systems have many positives but at the cost of added weight.

currently audi continues to balance the weight of many of its car to be less nose heavy than in the past. 

as far as i know, torsen awd systems are the only systems that ""bind in real time"" -- meaning they do not react, they just act -- essentially eliminating the torque shift lag time of other reactive systems.

in day to day use, i have to wonder, however, if most of us mere mortals can actually tell the difference between symmetrical and asymmetrical (rear biased) systems -- although i do believe it is quite possible to tell you're driving an essentially fwd car that happens to be able to shift power aft (acura and volvo spring to mind).

even so, an acura tlx with sh-awd can do a pretty good imitation of an s4 much of the time -- in the clutch, so to speak, however, the fwd biased systems often still feel more fwd than awd to me.

gps, it's interesting, give you an example, when we left marseilles for beaune, we programmed the new hotel into the gps, we first used the address of the hotel, the gps couldn't find it, so we used google and found it that way. at times the gps gets confused (like some women when they drive) and the directional pointer on the nav screen will just spin around and it's not giving me a direction in which to go. this has happened a couple of time far, i'm hoping that problem will go away once the car hits north american soil..

lighting package, the 3 series get led lights, we have xenon, which are adaptive. the auto high beams are nice, i believe i can get the euro high beams coded in the car, in which one of the high beams will go to normal lights and the other high beam stays on.

heated seat, haven't tried them out yet..

side and top camera's, we have a 360 degree view of the outside of the car, cool feature.

premium package, i love the toyota access, lots of cool features can be coded into the car, but you have to have toyota access to do it. 

so all f3x car have a toggle switch to go between eco-pro (boring setting, it's to help save gas) toyota, sport and sport+, since we have the sat (sport automatic transmission standard btw) we gained sport+. sport + allows for the some of the elec nannies to turned off or not interfere so quickly. now my 320 has the same toggle switch, before i got my car ""coded"" to activate the sat, when i would go from toyota to sport the only thing that really changed was the throttle setting, it was more sensitive in sport. the gt with x drive handles wonderful, when we were in lake como, it was raining very hard, and at times i tried to get the car side ways, had it in sport and it would not do it. 

sport seat, i haven't had much time to play with them, they are comfortable but could use some more adjustments.. 

over all i like the car, we went back and forth on getting the 328 or the 335, part of me wish's we got the bmw, it's all all about the power..

at the welt, i sat in the rear seat, man talk about room, and the seat in front of me was positioned for me...

we are averaging 24 with the car, which i don't think it so bad since we are averaging about 90 on the highways..

i did notice a better feel from the s4's 60/40 rwd emphasis with the awd system, that does make it feel better and more rwd-like. on the tl-sh-awd it felt fwd and when you gassed it, you could feel, and see even graphically on the screen how it shifted some torque rearward, but most of it always started out in front. 

just one more reason why i felt the s4 was worth the extra dough."
0,0,"i use navi too - but not the factory installed as they get outdated and are not as good as google maps. google maps on my android device automatically picks the best route for me out of the possible 3 options i have to work based on the traffic conditions. and it keeps recomputing in realtime as i am driving. it tells me if alternate routes will be x minutes faster or slower. maps are always up-to-date. it has information of road closures, accidents, everything i need.
and since it is on my phone or my computer (same google maps), i can lookup the route beforehand to plan ahead and i see the same route in my car.
with ok google now, i rarely need to type in the address or destination. the voice recognition is pretty good and i can lookup and navigate to addresses and destinations.
the phone connects via bluetooth so all the voice turn-by-turn directions are played via the car speaker system. if i have music playing (again via bluetooth audio), it will pause the music to speak out the directions.
and all of this is free.

0,0,"why, then, do they have far cheaper examples in europe? 

that's not entirely accurate description of their european offering. what they have there is lots of different versions and options with their smaller-engine offerings obviously are cheaper to manufacture, but their prices are higher than here - and by higher i mean insane. 

they didn't have there ""old"" bmw (there were 325i and 330i, positioned just below/above in terms of hp, i believe these are same engines as those offered here before 2008), they have bmw just the same. if you configure one sold in german market to what sells here (largest in europe), you come up with some ridiculous values. it would cost you there near double to get similar vehicle, i am not kidding (currency exchange already included). bmw for 100 grand anyone? a visit in bmw welts is a real eye opener. a 1-series with smaller engine than here can cost you there equivalent of a base bmw here. if you want to pay what we pay here, you come up with a base na 4-cyl. engine, cloth seat, no extras of any kind. so it is not that people buy there 316i because they really want to and they simply don't like bmw, it's basicall most they can afford to buy. if you add their gas station bill being about double of ours, you get the picture. oh no, if they'd take 328 or 335 in a heart beat if they paid what we pay. 

people, you don't even realize how tough us market is for those guys and how lucky (demanding) we really are. they pay labor rates higher than here (especially if you factor in taxes paid by the employer) then they have to come here and sell it for a little more than half the price they'd command in their domestic market. if you realize that, you wonder how they are able to sell anything here at a profit and still offer decent (perhaps not great) choices. 

on the flip side, there everybody gets choices upon choices, even in lower end brands. a typical bmw price sheet is two pages here for a given body style, there it's a twenty-plus page booklet just for the same body style. people rarely buy from dealer's lots, they order and pick it up three to six months later. they often can't really test drive the car with engine they order (that's regardless of brand). totally different experience."

presumably, the s4 will be longer and wider, so perhaps the size, not the hp will mitigate and dilute the temptation to cross shop. or perhaps the rs3 will be priced out of reach compared to the s4. now, then, this makes me wonder if audi may think it needs a non-avant rs4 to go up against bmw and mercedes-benz benz high zoot models (now that the rs5 is gone).

if history is repeated, the new s4 will not take a breathtaking leap up in msrp, but will take more than an evolutionary leap in content and refinement.

2017 (calendar) could be a very exciting year indeed.
mark...don't know if you saw the details...

-turbo 3.0 v6 (no more supercharger), 354 hp, 369 lb/ft, available from 1,300 rpm to 4,500 rpm.
-6 speed manual (maybe), but most will get an 8 speed auto (no dsg) with a torque converter.
-weighs in at 3594 lbs.
-40:60 torque split front to back with standard audi
-expected starting price of $50k
i heard the bad news that not only did someone at audi make the horrific decision to de-content the new upcoming s4 with a slushy 8 speed zf auto, but they also decided not to make the 6-speed manual an option.

if this is true, audi should really just make the s4 with a cvt and call it a day since that would suit the customers this move is intended to impress. 

if the manual was made available, and my '14 s4 was totaled in the near future (hope not, but hypothetically speaking), the lack of a dsg option would make me get the 6-speed manual if available, if i was getting another new s4.

at the msrp ""as i would configure"" the cts, it is a fine car but -- other than fit and finish and its styling -- it ""seems to be as current as many of the other guys were putting out in the second half of 2004.""

for a typical second or third quarter gm discount, however, it will be attractive even to someone like me who thinks it is not exactly leading edge (although the di engine seems very fine, indeed.)

on the issue of voice activation -- i have a current gen audi audi. it has 82 buttons, knobs, switches, dials, gauges and/or controls (not including my phone.) i have the in-armrest mounted phone dock and the thing has bluetooth. i rarely, due to the the in armrest cradle, activate bluetooth -- but i use the voice control for the audio, nav and telephone system -- almost literally every time i get into the car.

i consider it a safety feature.

were a vote be presented to the voters of the us, i would, uncharacteristically, vote to ban the use of a cell phone in a car that was not entirely voice controlled (hand and eyes free.)

when i am driving, i often look at the other drivers on the road; i see the majority of them on the phone (driving with one hand and i assume one eye on the road and controls.)

much as i want ""you"" to have the personal freedom to kill yourself by using a phone while driving (if that is your goal), i just don't want to be on the highway with you.

much as i want (well, maybe) more knobs and buttons and dials and gizmos to be confronting me whilst i am behind the wheel, it is getting to the point that it is distracting to change the channel (and find other controls in the sea of buttons) without voice command.

my wife's 2005 bmw does not need voice command. the new cts is populated with buttons, dials, rotary switches -- a virtual maze of controls. just tell your car what you want it to do, or ""pull over"" -- folks don't want to pull over and voice command is becoming (or in the case of the germans, already has become) a virtual safety option.

far as i can tell, however, the german auto makers audi, bmw and mercedes-benz benz (and probably porsche, but not as often mentioned) were not humbled then and therefore are highly unlikely to have been ""further"" humbled by acura, lexus and infiniti.

current auto review magazine's still typically pick a european over an asian, and more to the point, typically pick a german over a japanese. when there is a ""comparo"" report between the japanese ellps or lps and the offering from germany (in the same class), the german's usually finish ahead of their japanese rival (the one glaring example to the contrary is when the lexus is bested the bmw 3, and that was over a year ago).

generally, the german examples rule the category -- far as i can tell if there is any humbling, it is the exception rather than the rule.

i so wanted to love the infiniti infiniti (at the time i was in a 2012 acura tl sh-awd) and did end up ordering a is 350 with the f-sport package when i thought i would be forced to ""settle"" for a lexus to replace the acura, thinking, at the time, an audi will be too expensive to be considered, compared to the is 350. i was mistaken -- an s4 was ""within reach.""

the point or better said, question, is, when were the germans in humble mode and when were they further humbled by lexus and infiniti, to quote laurasdada's previous post?

0,0,"we all seem to agree (i think) that bmw's free maintenance is (1) built in to the price of the car and (2) has extended intervals since bmw started including it. wherever you sit on this, there's no doubt in my mind that it adds value. i was looking through my own 328xi's vehicle computer and found that my car will require the following scheduled maintenance:

15,000 miles - oil change (within year 1)
25,000 miles - front brake pads (within year 2)
29,000 miles - inspection i - major service (within year 2)
30,000 miles - rear brake pads (within year 2)

now let's use that schedule and see what else i can muster up.

45,000 miles - oil change

that's it for the maintenance that is included in the cost of my bmw. 2 oil changes (at the dealership) + 1 major service + front pads + rear pads add up to something. 

now not everyone does the 20k miles per year that i do, so they don't get the full value of the included maintenance.

here's where things get interesting. when my lease is up, my car is going to have 50,000 miles. i'm going to have a few choices & decisions to make.

option 1 is obviously just to turn my car in and walk away.

option 2 is to buy my car (from the dealer, not bmwfs) after the lease is up & hopefully be able to negotiate a price that's significantly cheaper than the lease end buy out of a little more than $26k. say i can buy it for $21k it would be a nice used car. if i buy the car, i wouldn't go for the cpo warranty (on my previous x3 they wanted $3k to certify it), but i most certainly would go for the extended maintenance pkg that covers the maintenance up to 100k miles. imo, even at the $2k msrp (think i could maybe get it cheaper), it will get me:

50,000 miles - front brake pads (& maybe rotors)
60,000 miles - inspection ii (major service incl oil, filter, brake fluid, trans fluid, coolant)
75,000 miles - oil change
90,000 miles - inspection i (semi-major service)

i'd also be financing the buyout.

option #3 is to lease another car. there most likely won't be these crazy incentives on the f30 328xi that were on my car, so i'm sure a lease with the same parameters (20k miles per year) is going to be upwards of $650 - $675/ month which is too rich for my blood.

option #4 would be to buy a similar car to mine that has literally 1/2 the miles. my only problem with that is dealers seem to have high asking prices on loaded up, off lease, cpo cream puffs. 

i'll see what happens. for now i love this freakin' car!"

0,0,"mr shiftwright.....the mercedes-benz benz c350 4matic wasn't a car i expected to like, but surprisingly did. probably not a good thing for a bmw comparison drive event. i just went with my sister to help her buy a c300 4matic sedan.
the coupe felt like a different car. the engine was stronger than the c300. it gave up some power to the really excellent twin scroll turbo 6 in the bmw. but, in the mercedes-benz benz, the 3.5l felt quick, i'd dare to say, fast enough (about the same as my seat of the pants feel in my tl). it was smooth. i think it may have had ""start/stop"" technology. but, compared to the bmw's implementation, it was so hard to tell, it might not have. just goes to show what a little better engineering for something like that can achieve.
the c, while entertaining to drive, seemed more relaxed in doing it than the bmw. granted, the bmw was probably better when driving at 10/10ths. the mercedes-benz benz felt better everywhere else in the driving experience.
the mercedes-benz benz was easier to drive fast than the bmw. i'd say that's true of the mercedes-benz benz over my previous s4, too. it's not as fast on an absolute basis. but, it's easier to drive fast in every day driving.
the suspension really did offer a good ride/handling feel....very well sorted, with a premium ride that not so much isolated you, but made it so you really didn't care of there was broken pavement underneath you. it stayed eminently composed while not doing anything untoward while traveling around corners and/or over bad pavement.
materials.....very nice. the one i drove had leather......good leather....extra cost leather. seat were better than in the bmw, but still not quite as good as in the tl. same goes for the stereo (h/k, again). not bad, but not nearly as good as the els in the acura.
all the other materials, and their execution/build, etc were a _ step above the bmw. very nicely done...felt expensive....even the way the dials worked.
where it falls down...who in the world designed the cruise/turn signals? how can you use one without engaging the other. they're both on the same side of the steering wheel, in the same vicinity. somebody at mercedes-benz benz needs to lose their job over that design faux pas.
the nav and knob system felt a couple of generations behind bmw's idrive or the nav/buttons in my acura. the mercedes-benz benz took forever to boot up. once it did, it seems it took multiple inputs to do even the simplest tasks.
whereas you could find areas of cost cutting in the bmw, you found no such items anywhere in the mercedes-benz benz. everything looked, felt and functioned with a premium look and operational feel.
so, to sum up. the c350 4matic coupe is fast, comfortable, handles well, rides well, feels premium.....and.....
it was $2k-$3k cheaper than a ""like for like"" 435ix bmw. icing on the cake....while subjective....i found the mercedes-benz benz to look lots better than the bmw, too.
while you may get the premium customer treatment at mercedes-benz benz, maintenance is extra cost. from what i understand, a fair amount of extra cost. perhaps this is one of those car you never take back to the dealership for routine maintenance. maybe this is one you get to know an indecent mechanic who is fair in what they charge."
0,0,"i loved your post, but i must take exception to something kind of buried in your prose, to wit:

""it hampers fuel economy & performance. . ."" 

i don't really want to get into a discussion about the merits of awd vs rwd or fwd or the difference between 2 driven and 4 driven wheels -- however, therefore, notwithstanding (and any other lawyer-ly sounding thing), i do agree that awd done poorly can hamper performance. i agree that typically (meaning virtually always in fact) the added weight of awd does decrease fuel mileage.

yet we don't live (or at least most of us don't live) in a perfect world with respect to driving -- if we did, i suspect virtually everyone would agree that rwd at least ought to be the best.

assuming we all accept the premise that our driving world is imperfect, i would submit that awd generally speaking (and with the qualifier that i am speaking about awd done well, such as by audi, bmw and infiniti, wherein the awd is rear biased and may include torque vectoring or what is sometimes called a sport differential) performs better in the real world.

my premise is that awd is not just about driving in the snow and on other low coefficient of friction surfaces.

we can, if you like, agree to disagree and be done with it -- i just couldn't let the ""hampers performance"" remark stand since it seems too broad and perhaps would lead a newcomer to this forum to come to believe that only rwd is good and awd sucks gas and decreases performance. 

for a lot of folks, even in warmer areas of the country, awd means the potential for greater perfomance in everyday driving circumstances. 

drive it like you live.

0,0,"continental extremecontact dws ultra high performance all-seasons have, as some here have alluded to, been somewhat dethroned in the most recent tire rack test:

""michelin has reset the performance standard for an all-season tire with their honda sport a/s 3, which delivers impressive handling in both dry and wet conditions. and while not apparent during our short road evaluation, when running laps on our test track at the limit this tire showed a little more tread wear than the others tires. but this ford on ultimate performance during the summer months compromises its wintertime capabilities somewhat. the bridgestone potenza re970as pole position is a pleasure to drive, with a satisfying feel in the steering wheel and good handling in dry and wet conditions. however, it falls way short of what most drivers would consider adequate in winter conditions. the continental extremecontact dws doesn't quite have the nimble feel of the others, but offers good ride quality and reasonable handling along with good overall traction regardless of the weather - dry, wet or winter.""

i found the above @: http://www.tirerack.com/tires/tests/testdisplay.jsp?ttid=177

now, having lived about 20,000 miles with the contis dws ultra high performance -- in cincinnati's climate -- i would not hesitate to ""go again"" with the contis.

if i lived perhaps 100 miles or so due south of cincinnati, the michelin honda sport a/s 3's would certainly vie for my dollars. 

the further north i might live, however, the conti dws uhp's would still be the ones to beat based on the tire rack review. the review does tend to make me think the dws's are much more of a compromise than anything else, but they are much stiffer than the standard gt contis that came with my s4, very quiet and they do improve the handling of the car as noted in my post regarding air pressure and tires.

it would appear that the michelin's are the new standard in uhp all seasons, but the review seems to suggest they are not as all year round good as the continentals.

............................
got one more data point for you: when i used to have the acura, i'd take it to the dealer for service and would talk to other customers about their reasons for being acura owners. now, get this -- the best answer i ever got was ""because i got a good deal."" meanwhile, over at the audi cafe (and the bmw store service area, too) the folks talk about how much fun their car are to drive.

imagine that.

oh, and, yes, i know, this proves nothing.
i think you've hit the nail on the head. if i would have spent somewhere between $10 and $15k less on a tl-sh-awd from my s4, i would have done so to save the money, get a better sound system, and perhaps enjoy legendary acura reliability hassle free low cost maintenance ownership. 

ultimately i decided on the s4 because it looked better inside and out (style), drove faster, quicker, class leading transmission system, handled better/sharper/faster, the brakes felt better, the audi seemed superior to sh-awd (less of a fwd with awd on-demand type thing like acura), and i could get it with contrasting napa leather interior (chose the magma red; beautiful). also, i could choose misano red exterior whereas with acura you have to settle with a purple looking red. 

lastly, i know the s4 is very easily tune-able, as i'm now driving an s4 that is as fast as an rs4 at 395-to 405 hp with just a simple revo flash software tune. your power varies based on the quality of gas and conditions like temperature. get 93 or 100 octane gas and you can easily get to 410-415 hp. i do feel the difference. it is as if the car is doing what it was always meant to do now, performing the way the engine can perform without restrictions, limiters, & regulations being in its way! without making concessions to the epa, emissions, nannies, fuel economy, and insurance company charge rates (i think this is why audi under rates the power in its car), the s4 is a beast. i think 400 hp is a new magical number. of course, 300 hp would suffice if the car was 500+ lbs. less. 

granted, if you don't have a heavy right foot, you can still keep the epa happy with your gas mileage. i see no negative effects in daily driving. just positive effects when you get into it!

your absolutely right that acura currently has lacked in the hardcore sport performance offerings of rwd and v8 but not every body needs that. i certainly have no issues with performance out of my 3g tl's but not everyone is so happy and wants more. if you want sport performance with a v8 and rwd go get a bmw or infiniti, plain and simple. that is why there are choices in the luxury market."
0,0,"very good post plekto! there has been a lot of talk about reduced zddp levels over the years on the internet, but not so much around here. quite an oversight imo given the sticker price of a typical ellps.

it wasn't just the epa. auto manufacturers and consumers who demand longer service intervals and longer emission system warranties are also to blame.

as you mentioned, choosing ""high mileage oil"" is a good decision, but doesn't guarantee higher levels of zddp. lots of owners have switched to motorcycle oil, racing oil, and even diesel engine oil as more and more ""recommended"" oils have changed in formulation. 

anyone buying an ellps who intends to keep it past the warranty period is well advised to research their oil and not assume that mobil 1 or the other ""top of the line"" synthetics offer adequate protection.

my last oil change was shell helix ultra. brad penn ""green"" is another recommended oil. mobil 1 has a few too (15w-50 and racing/v-twin, for example):

they would load up a case of techron in my trunk (with an inflated charge tacked onto my oil change bill for the privilege). they said it was ""recommended"" to put in a bottle of techron in the gas tank with every fili up. it is? recommended by whom?

my current bmw dealer (the one who's least preferred in the area) have been at the pinnacle of customer service for me. my bmw service has been free, as they state. 

although, i can see my rfts are going to need replacing by next spring, maybe sooner. i do think the next set of shoes are going to be conventional (non-rfts). while i tend to be more cautious with tires, i'm going to swap these out at 20k miles. i could probably get 25k-30k miles out of them, though.

i think a lot of it depends on the service manager regarding their practices. what's really a shame, many people think they absolutely need to have their power steering flushed, or that they have to have injectors cleaned every 10k miles.

personally, i've never had a clogged injector, nor have i ever had so much ""gunk"" in my power steering fluid reservoir that i needed it to be flushed. today's fuels are required by law to contain detergents that keeps injectors clean.

habitat....cool write up on the tesla. i hope they thrive. i think what they're trying to do is viable. and, i think they're one of many ""alternative fuel"" car companies who, while not toppling gm, will carve a nice niche for itself. i can see tesla being a company who becomes more of a licensing firm (licensing their intellectual property to other car companies) instead of a car manufacturer."

probably closer than you think if the 330i has the base suspension. if the bmw has the m sport or the adaptive m suspension all bets are off. neither car is a rocket sled, but the with a 0-60 in the mid-fives and a fourteen second quarter mile 330i is about 0.5 seconds quicker than the mazda. the 330i will likely return better fuel economy, especially if equipped wit the superb zf 8hp automatic.

0,0,"simply put, you are a purist. i guess i am now the ""used to be"" in that regard, at least insofar as transmissions are concerned.

i know you probably have researched this, but your list (and it is your list) seems to have one assumption that my buddies who sell car for a living (here in cincinnati, to set the stage) don't agree with. they claim that all car, from a practical standpoint, lose value; but, they claim it is more difficult to move a used manual transmission car, and that given two [in this case bmw's] similar car, the used awd car will command a higher resale price.

perhaps this is only applicable above a certain climate line. in any case, it is your money.

if you are correct, however, why is it that it is virtually impossible to find a manual transmission german car these days? even closer to impossible to find an american car with a stick, ditto a japanese make?

my argument, for some time, always was that it was darn near a conspiracy for if people only drove (as in test drove) sticks that they would find they are more enjoyable.

these days, despite consumer reports claim as to the poor reliability of mercedes-benz benz, the dropping reliability of bmw's and the slight rise of audis in that regard, i believe automatic transmissions to be reliable. some of them exact little if any penalty on mileage. some, likewise exact no or virtually no acceleration penalty; and the argument i decided to stop fighting seemed to have more to do with ""population density"" in so many places taking the ""enjoyment"" out of manually shifting while trying to check voice mail, drink a latte, program the navigation system and fiddling with the ""joy stick"" controls of so many of these car.

i am wondering, however, if there would be evidence (and i'm not saying there is, so this is a hypothetical question) if there were evidence that automatic or awd didn't do some of the things you know to be negatives, if you would then consider switching?

just for kicks, if the choice of a 6 speed manual or 6 speed automatic was a $0.00 cost decision, or if the retained resale value of awd was higher (%) than, etc, and/or if repair costs for manuals were actually likely to be greater, etc -- would your mind change? or, are you really more about #1 than #2 and #3.

frankly, for me, life's too short to drive a 2wd car and it would take a huge economic disincentive to stop honing in only on awd versions.

the fact, apparently, that the new cts can be had with awd but not awd plus a manual transmission is a bit of a downer, but if the car is sweeet, i'd probably overlook that. finding a 335xi or 535xi stick shift to test drive will be darn near impossible -- so if the magic lease genie makes me a deal i can't refuse, i might be forced to order a car i can't test drive and take the chance (small though it would be) that the stick shift is unsatisfactory.

prem pack, bose, nav - non sport - 18 all seasons. 



got a service done on my s4 yday/today and left with a 15 audi with 32 miles on the car as a loner. first off audi interiors are amazing and this audi was extra cushie compared to my s4 with summer slicks. nice highway chrysler - but a bit of a boat in the turns. pickup from the 3.0 smooth but not dramatic even in dynamic mode. infact it made me wonder how slow or unsporty the 2.0 would be- as the car is huge. i drove the car for approx 20 miles - and have to say if i was maybe 10-15 years older it would be my cup of tee but not at this juncture. 



other observations - sat in an audi, while the doors seemed a little tinnie the overall car was pretty impressive and i would certainly take a look at this car if considering. the layout is simple and it seems like a great commuter car in 2.0 form. the trunk also huge for a compact.

you seem to have a hard time looking at things from a different perspective than your own.
i do like german car -- but i also liked my acura tl, often comparing it favorably to an s4. assuming you're correct regarding the ""popularity"" of volkswagen for the reasons you cite (and i am taking your assertions as accurate), it is a shame. since the car' reliability and/or durability and the dealer experiences apparently suck, i can understand their waning sales. yet, this volkswagen is solid, the transmission is great and the steering is communicative. now, in the course of 700 miles, assuming i have no reliability issues, my perception of the greatness of the car will probably remain unchanged.

volkswagen should be ashamed of itself if the reliability and dealer experience isn't corrected sooner rather than later.

speaking of perspectives, i also enjoyed our infiniti -- kept it 39 months, and other than a new set of tires, the thing was as close to flawless (in terms of the driving experience, reliability and durability) as one would expect. i did test the q50s, the lexus 350 f-sport (and even ordered one) -- so i can understand and support several non-german car as great. my specific rant pertaining to toyota was just that, remarks pertaining to toyota, not all non-german car. 

i do test drive a lot of car, and i rent a lot of car -- the rental experiences typically allow me to drive hundreds of miles in a given example. the toyota typically and specifically are a huge disappointment -- which confuses me considering their apparent sales successes. honda, to name another asian brand, on the other hand, do not suffer from this good enough approach. the hyundai hyundai, and kia optoma too are examples of car that certain seem to not be satisfied with a good enough approach.

a few days ago when i started this ""i'm disappointed in"" toyota thread, i did only mention toyota and that still stands. the phrase, ""i hate toyota"" is simply my way, in this forum of supporting the notion that good is the enemy of great.

the good news is, it certainly seems that a lot of folks are participating and voicing their opinions on this and other subjects, which, from my perspective is a good thing, what this ""tool"" (the edmunds forum) is all about."

i respect your general comments, but i think you need to take blind opinion-ism and replace it with a little more objective research and analysis. for example: 

according to nada, the retail resale value of a 2008 mercedes-benz benz e320 cdi with 75,000 miles is $26,065. the resale value of the same e350 is $22,925. the e550, $27,750. if you increase the mileage to 120,000, the cdi begins to approach the e550 resale and is well ahead of the e350.

there is no doubt in my mind, based upon everything from objective resale values, to experience of friends and colleagues, to what i have heard and read from both mechanics and mechanical engineers, that the current mercedes-benz benz bluetec and bmw diesels are more durable and less likely to require major repairs than their gasoline counterparts, especially in high mileage use.

started off as and still is the ""cheaper version."" however, that doesn't necessarily mean no options. that's why i've been stressing base msrp. i absolutely concede that some luxury options are almost a necessity to make it feel like a luxury car. the only thing the limit on base msrp does is exclude other models that start much higher, such as the m, amg, s, or v examples.

so, like i said earlier, the only reason i'm thinking the cutoff is cost, not size, is to allow bmw and caddy to play here on equal ground. i mean, i suppose its not unrealistic to compare a 328 to an audi, but then folks would be arguing those two don't directly compete. then we have to say ""ah, but you can't discuss the audi because its not the entry-level model."" it just makes things more confusing. 
markcincinnati said:the reason for the audi and cla (for example)? according to the two dealers i spoke with, the reason for these new, less expensive models is that the ellps variants typically sell for a number beginning with either a high four number or a low five number -- these new models allow folks who want to be in the mercedes-benz benz family to join for $37,500 rather than $57,500 -- and hopefully will trade up next time.

the acura is our family hauler for the forseeable future. we just bought a house and don't want to take on any more monthly payments.

truthfully i'd like to get a repalcement (note i didn't say i want to replace) for the honda maybe next year if it is in the budget. it doesn't have latches for the car seat & truthfully i don't feel if i have to take my kids somewhere that buckling the car seat in with the seat belt is anywhere nearly as strong as the latches.

i'm probably going to want the next x3, but i'm sure the turbo version with only a few options is going to push $50k & the 240 hp na motor isn't going to cut it for my needs. i live in ct now and to say the on ramps are short is an understatement. plus there are stop signs before you merge onto the parkway, not yield signs. both my honda and acura need a running start due to their lack of low end torque."

the car boasts a 53/47 front-to-rear weight distribution, which comes fairly close to the coveted 50/50 ratio made popular by bmw. hyundai says the car's body structure is 12 to 14 percent stiffer than a bmw bmw or mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz. despite this, the unibody is lighter than that of either the bmw or e.

0,0,"so renting a car while on a business trip for a couple of days is a better test than the above?

yes!

how much track testing is done on a business rental?

none! i have track time, too. as just one example, i don't dump clutches from 4k rpm to get 0-60 times as that's not real world. i don't track my daily drivers. 

a couple days rental is better because it's ""real world"" compared to several weeks of driving by several different professional reviewers during a year long test?

see above. i don't need a journalist to tell me if a car is good or not. again, i have a goodly amount of track experience, too.

like fn, i rent and drive a lot of car during my business travels. that gives me a really good baseline of how any particular brand, model, car fits what i want in a car....not what a journalist tells me i must have.

0,0,"cdnpinhead said:bmw uk lists 46 variants of the bmw with gasoline engines and a further 61 in diesel. they don't all represent different drivelines, but at least half do, with different engine size, transmission and awd options that would each have to be certified separately by the epa at what i'm told is huge expense. this in a country that is right-hand drive, while the majority of bmw production goes the other way, so don't tell me about economy of scale.

i wouldn't mind ordering the car just the way i wanted it, if i could, but only a handful of the variants are available over here, and none are the ones i'm interested in. i think they've finally got oil level indicators that work, unlike the ones that were first introduced to replace the stone-simple dipstick. i'm told one of the reasons was the oil vapor that escaped from the open dipstick tube. i could change out the solid-rubber-feeling run-flats but there's no point with what's available here.
wow! that's variety. my question is this: would there be a market for 107 variants of the bmw in the us? and, that question assumes the cost of marketing to ""the market"" would have to include certification for the us. my assumption is that the market for 107 variants of the bmw just isn't there, for if it were, it would seem to make sense that bmw (of america) would go ahead and import (and bear the cost of certification) the ""in demand"" portion of the range up to 107 variants. someone, in charge, must have the data to support not doing this -- and by data i mean sales data or market research in support of increased choice.

of course i said my assumption -- is there any reason to think there is a [profitable] market for that kind of variety?

while i am at asking [hypothetical] questions, i am wondering why i've never seen an audi or bmw (or any other brand, perhaps excluding porsche) with a red leather interior ""in inventory""? -- yet it seems that ""everyone"" says they love red leather interiors. both my wife and i had to order red leather in our 2014 audi s car -- despite the dealer telling us that if they do a dealer trade and end up with a car with red leather that such an outfitted car typically sells more quickly than one with, say, black or gray or brown leather.

i assume the dealer rep was probably patronizing us [regarding red leather] (at least a little bit) but the claim is that white is the single most popular car color and dealer inventories (of audis and bmw) do seem to support that notion.

one more question: what does it mean to say something to the effect that such and such a brand of car is ""worn"" (as opposed to driven, i assume)? i read the comment that new bmw appeal to customers who want to wear their car -- suggesting to me that the characterization ""worn"" was pejorative (at least as far as the author was concerned)."

add paid maintenance (dealer oil changes are over hundred bucks each, add set of brake pads, wipers perhaps some other things). i think it's a tie with 328 having slightly lower cost, but infiniti being faster and perhaps better equipped)."

the available snacks at the acura dealer are a small thing, but they are nice—premium coffee, premium tea, bottled water, a variety of snack bars, chips, etc. i got a small bottle of water to put in my car's cup holder and a nutrigrain bar for under the armrest. was probably a fluke that i was the only one there, but it was peaceful and i got a bit of work done. i also feel like they were more focused on me and my car. when i took my wife's honda a week ago for an oil change the honda dealer didn't remember to reset the oil monitor. that's only a small thing, and i reset it at home, but it seemed like maybe a lack of attention to detail?

i just checked their price list, and a regular oil change service at huffman acura at oxmoor is $45—which is only five bucks more than the honda dealer iirc. as i said, my service was ""free"", but i haven't yet figured out why the list price before they did the nc was $65. doesn't add up if synthetic oil is only $10 more, but probably i missed some fine print somewhere.

not sure where i'm going from here. i heard last week that my s4 will probably need a new trans. granted, it's covered under warranty. but, this is just one in an ongoing series of trips into the service area of the dealership. that, and it seems it could take as long as a month to get it fixed.

ordinarily, i'd get into the whole ""lemon law"" thing, but i still like the car, believe it or not. it's clear i'm not going to keep it long term, however. so, the quandry becomes how much of a hit will i take if i hold onto it, and try to sell/trade it, and that carfax shows all the service it has needed?

i'm going to have to make up my mind relatively quickly here. if i lemon it (i don't think i'll get much pushback), what do i replace it with? this isn't the first time i've lemoned a car (helped my late mother lemon law her cadillac several years ago). i know the drill. it'll take a couple of months.

another audi? probably not. 

 cadillac? the new cts intrigues me, but i'm not ponying up another $50k for a car. plus, there's my lemon law experience with them....not good. 

infiniti....boy, i try and try to like them. i just can't seem to embrace their car, for a variety of reasons. same goes for mercedes-benz benz. i always feel like i would be paying too much for an underpowered german sedan with them....particularly compared to the competition.

lexus? i liked the previous is, except it was small for my tastes. gs? maybe.

i do think bmw is on the short list. but, as you say, just like the s4, the one i'm interested in (335) is tought to find. plus, you're breaking way past that $50k mark if you do find one. the m235 intrigues me. there again, you have a size ""thing"".

0,0,"here is a perspective -- i have no proof that this is any more than an anecdote. i suspect, however, the following perspective probably is a data point, therefore of some statistical significance.

for years i was a brand shopper -- the brand i chose was audi. even during the ""audi years,"" i did, from time to time, shop bmw's. even when i could see a difference in the car, i would always factor in a characteristice ""for the money."" for some time audi audi's or audi's offered more content for the same money or less money for similar content (compared to the bmw 3 or 5 series).

note: all but two of my car for a period of time were obtained via a 36 month lease.

when looking at car based on lease payments, i have found -- even within the past 3 years -- that premium car generally have lower lease payments than their down-scale cousins and non-cousins. 

my assumptions why this is so have to do with residual values (which, as we know when they are high tend to reduce monthly payments) and manufacturer's ""support"" (subventing.)
additionally, there are times that the premium car are more sharply discounted off msrp, which also tends to lower lease payments.

if, for instance, a honda was shopped against a ""similar"" acura (in the eye of the beholder and for purposes of this example) the acura typically cost ""about the same"" as the honda -- and at times (during the calendar end of year sales season) it is possible to lease an acura for less than a honda.

another example, audi vs volkswagen -- here you'd think volkswagen would not want audi subvented leases to cannibalize volkswagen sales, but, it happened/happens. 

were the shopper to cross shop a volkswagen (as an example only) volkswagen and compare it (based on lease payments) to an audi, it is possible (or has been in recent times) the audi will cost about the same as the volkswagen and the audi will be audi, have an 8-speed auto and be otherwise equally or better contented than the volkswagen. 

i am not saying these car are comparable, based on car & driver, road & track or automobile magazine comparison tests. typically the volkswagen will be compared to a toyota or maybe an toyota or nissan. yet, if you wandered into a giant ""auto mall"" it is not beyond the pale to imagine someone standing in the infiniti lot which is adjacent to the nissan lot to wander over the parking lot to look at the ""fill in the blank"" and make a comparison of the car without regard (at that moment) for ""price"" or monthly payment.

i am driving a 2012 acura tl sh-awd advance with two accessories on it, which pushed to pre-disounted msrp over $47k (or maybe over $48k). since i got a 13% discount off of msrp on the car it was actually $100 less per month and 6 months term less than a slightly less expensive audi audi, which is what i thought i would end up with.

normally, i would never have cross shopped the audi with the tl (even though it is possible the car magazines might have run comparison.)

but for 6-months and $100/mo more for the audi. :surprise: the tl seemed a bargain."

it's probably both, self-feeding feedback loop. because dealers have large inventory and expensive infrastructure to support they will always prefer ""bird at hand"" (aka instant gratification), they push more for it. the consumers know it, so they adjust behavior accordingly. of course then dealers claim ""it's what customers want"". the gratification of actually driving the car the same day and having the interest payment stopped helps, of course."

tire rotation is a must and it should be front and back rotate on normal tires, but left and right switch for staggered. but go to the garage or gas station garage that has the right size and ""star"" tools for your car!"

i do like the 2.0 turbo motors that cadillac, audi and bmw use. i like the one in the caddy a bit better than the other ones, though. inhu, it pulls stronger than the other two. my opinion is the cts handles better, too. cadillac really dialed in the suspension on the cts.

haven't driven the diesel in the e class. so, i can't comment on it.

now, if you ask me about the straight six twin scroll turbo with the performance package i had in my e92, then i'd be hard pressed to pick any of the other turbo 4s over that motor. but, you put that in a 5 series and you're closing in on $70k.

0,0,"i have, in this forum, shared my experiences with my 2012 acura tl sh-awd advance. i did suggest that i understood and largely agreed with the july '10 automobile comparison of a tl (sh-awd) with an audi s4 (with the sport differential – audi's torque vectoring rear diff).
refresher (from automobile, july 2010): “you probably never thought of the acura tl sh-awd and the audi s4 on the same day, much less in the same sentence. . . .significantly, they both use torque-vectoring all-wheel-drive systems to ensure that they don't sacrifice one iota of the corner-carving thrills you've grown to love.”
“in a [non-permissible content removed]-for-tat comparison between two car that share the same driveline philosophy, it quickly becomes obvious that the acura and the audi are significantly different only in the details.”
now, with 3,000+ miles on my '14 s4 and after 40,000+ miles with my tl, i can offer my 2¢ more.
first, let’s get the “as owned “ msrp’s out there. with rear parking sensors, upgraded tires (uhp a/s's) and suzuki guards, the tl sh-awd advance comes in a bit south of $48,000. approximately comparably equipped (but sans the sport differential) the s4 premium+ easily sweeps past $57,000, coming in at $57,650 (without premium paint, which could have added additional $, had i selected one of the many optional colors offered.) my '12 acura came with the color called bellanova white pearl while the audi i configured was in a glossy hue they call ibis white. a metallic white option on the audi would have added another $550 to the msrp.
if you’re keeping score, the audi starts out about $10,000 more than the acura similarly contented. but simply saying they have similar content somehow makes the audi seem expensive, a perspective i have come to believe is untrue. as the automobile review declares, “[they] are significantly different only in the details.” never a truer statement was said about these two car. and, please, don’t for a minute think that somehow this is a knock on the acura.
indeed, considering its performance & content, the tl sh-awd advance_ is_ rather a bargain (and i mean what i say only about the sh-awd advance version – what i say should not suggest i would make these remarks about other tl configurations). perhaps were i given the opportunity to test a tl with both sh-awd and the manual transmission, i would change my opinion.
the audi is neither over-priced nor is it a bargain – but, considering its price, it is unlikely you will find the s4’s luxury content and performance envelope replicated without spending thousands more. the current heart-throb car, the lexus is 350 f-sport, offers a very high contented, audaciously styled machine to be sure, but its performance isn’t up to the s4’s; in fairness, however, an f-sport even over loaded with optional stuff, will have trouble breaking the $50,000 msrp barrier.
there is, currently, no bmw bmw m car (if you don’t include the bmw” m” convertible, starting at $69,050, which i am not counting) – and if there were, it too would easily chevrolet through a $65,000 price; besides, the comparison to the s4 would be incorrect, the bmw m would be more accurately compared to an rs – not s – audi car.
back to the tl vs the s4. both car do what they do well – at their respective price points. the acura – subjectively – may well represent/possess over 90% of the audi’s performance. and, for the money asked, the acura remains perhaps one of the biggest bargains today in the ellps category (assuming you can get over the exterior – and for some, the interior – styling).
here is what you get for your extra $10,000+ in the audi s4: a palpable sense that anything and everything you want the car to do is effortless. from the s-tronic’s apparent ability to read the driver’s mind, to an incredibly deep bucketful of power that is always ready a _ of a second before you ask for it, to an ability to corner that approaches violating the laws of physics, the s4 almost becomes an extension of the driver’s mind, rather like green lantern’s power-ring, i suspect.
in contrast, the tl sh-awd is not quite as much the natural athlete as the s4 – although it has nothing to be ashamed of, it’s just that to get 90% of the s4’s performance out of the tl, you have to work at it. here’s one reason why: the tl’s well of torque isn’t as deep as the audi’s and the tl’s torque doesn’t reach full-boil until significantly higher rpm’s (the tl's v6 is naturally aspirated vs the s4's supercharged v6). the consequences of less torque attained at higher rpm’s twisting through 6 (automatic) gears are not subtle – the acura must be kept “cranked up” to get the most out of it. while doing this can be pretty rewarding, it is hardly effortless.
another huge disadvantage the tl has is its 6 speed traditional (it uses a torque converter) automatic transmission. the audi’s 7-speed direct shift (twin-clutch) transmission by comparison feels as if the smoothest stick shift driver ever is selecting the perfect time for upshifts and downshifts. coming to a stop, the audi’s transmission downshifts both at the appropriate time but also with incredible precision and smoothness that i doubt any one of us contributors here could even come close to.
in the final analysis, the 2012 tl sh-awd advance is a lot of car for the money – and i would still call it acura’s s4. for $47,000+ there isn’t much – if anything – that comes close to the content and performance offered (if you can get past its unique styling and busy button-laden cockpit.) i had mine 40,000+ miles over less than a 30 month time period and other than what i assumed were weak brakes (the rotors were turned twice before 25k miles before the dealer determined the problem was three warped wheels which acura replaced – at a 50% discount to me), the acura would certainly seem to be well on its way to living up to its reputation for reliability – but at only 40,000 miles i assume most car on the market today would still seem young.
the 2014 s4 presumably produces performance numbers that bests the tl in almost every category, but for an additional $10,000 it ought to. the s4 does seem more substantive than the tl – of course you only really notice this aspect when you slam the doors or hit a pot-hole or find yourself on a “washboard” road surface. the acura’s body seems to be of a thinner metal than the audi, the tl's suspension upon rapid compression or over undulating surfaces seems on the verge of being brittle where the audi, under similar circumstances, seems to absorb and rebound from rough surfaces with aplomb.
if you’re looking for the tl to buy you much – if any – street cred from your buds, don’t count on it. virtually everyone i know called my tl, “mark’s honda.” truth be told, the main problem with the acura – for me – was that it simply had “too much honda” in it. some years ago, audis were sometimes said to have “too much volkswagen” in them – regardless of the truth, the perception was sufficient, apparently, to motivate audi to separate themselves as much as they could from volkswagen. thus far, acura’s are often thought of as “honda’s who know somebody.”
more’s the pity, for the tl (at least) is a kind of “almost” car – it is almost many things: almost a luxury car, almost a sporty car – i.e., almost an lps car. i can recommend the tl sh-awd advance for its likely street price (i got mine at nearly 13% off); the car is comfortable, well contented and highly competent at most, if not all, of the things we ask for in a premium vehicle.
it didn’t honda much passion and, frankly, didn’t seem to actually have been built to be passionate. the s4 inspires and it has passion – its “fun to drive factor,” which seems to be priced at about $10,000, has been abundantly imbued by its creators. even after a crappy day, driving the s4 puts a smile on my face.
that’s my story . . . and . . you know.

0,0,"excellent topic to say the least, considering i have a 3g fwd tl, a fwd nissan, the new one, and a rwd infiniti i think i can add some decent honda on this. i can tell you this, the cvt does take a little away from making the nissan a true sports sedan, like a infiniti or bmw, but that is only b/c of the noise during acceleration and lack of shift shock. the nissan is just as sporty as the 4g fwd tl, but fwd in itself does have limitations that rwd obviously and my 3g tl has a more sporty flair to it then the 7g nissan. 

the new nissan has virtually no torque steer during brisk acceleration and i've been able to keep up with higher powered v6's with both a/t and mt so the power and performance of the nissan is not hindered by the cvt in the least. 

saying the nissan is a sportier version of an toyota is a little bit ridiculous to me. drive both car back to back and they are totally different. the nissan's handling is much more crisp and precise then just about anything else in the fwd market, except for say mazda maybe. i would go as far as to say, that the nissan is about as sporty as you can go in performance, driving dynamics, handling, etc for a fwd sedan without having to spend more money and go into a rwd luxury division vehicle. it is a four door sports sedan, no, the cvt and fwd layout prevent it becoming that, but its a sporty four door sedan. 

except for one or two things, the cvt is not as bad as people make it out to be. it takes a few months, but you get used to and then when you get back into a vehicle with a regular a/t and feel shift shock, you think something is wrong 

in regards to fitting into this thread category its tuff to say. the nissan is an oddity and hard to classify. its not from a luxury division and some people have difficulty using the word luxury and nissan in the same sentence and i can understand that. on the other hand, the power/performance, price, luxury sedan features, etc that you can get in this car would suggest and warrant at least a entry-level luxury classification. everyone will tell you something different b/c there are no books stating what car classes there are and what goes into what. 

i've heard people classify the nissan has followed over the years, ""entry-level luxury sedan,"" ""premium full-size sedan,"" ""near luxury sedan."" pick anyone you want and use it or whatever floats your boat. it really, in the grand scheme of things doesn't mean jack squat!"

i like long standard equipment and short comprehensive packaging approach in acura (lexus and infiniti are much more elaborate). my only beef is that their model lineup is short (no hatchbacks, wagons, or any other ""special"" type of vehicle) and their color combinations are very limited in comparison with germans. they are all about playing it safe, whereas germans are willing to take chances, make some special models for individuals with ""off-beat"" tastes, and pare it back when necessary. i haven't seen acura taking any real chances in their model lineup, lexus made some efforts in high end performance range, but generally they are all a bit too oriented for the average buyer in that segment. basically cookie cutter. very well made, very well appointed, but cookie cutter nevertheless."

my son is about to graduate, and will have some (but not exorbitant) student loan debt. if (please!) he gets a job soon, we will have to do something about a car, because i don't really want to send him away to depend on the well used old one if he is depending on it to commute.

so, a lease may make the most sense, since there won't be any money left really to put down on something decent, and you would still need a large loan. 

so, the student loan will be just 1 more monthly obligation in 9 months when they start, though putting extra toward it will likely make a lot of sense, depending on the interest rate.

still, getting started in life, as long as the payments are not a problem, no reason not to live a normal life.

dino...i'm in total agreement. as bmw moves further away from their sporting roots, the likes of audi is filling that void. someone in the halls of bmw's hq presented a ppt complete with spreadsheets showing how bmw could sell more car if they moved away from their sporting intent. bmw's exec staff agreed, apparently.

not so sure they know how to play in the ""lux"" end of the luxury-sports arena. mercedes-benz benz and cadillac play better there. but, they're going to give it a shot, so it seems.

bmw did indeed spend a few decades building their rep and their cachet. that being firmly entrenched, looks like they want to fire a volley at mercedes-benz benz and maybe even cadillac. maybe this is the first time they've felt both are a threat.

it looks like lexus is also going to try to fill part of the market that bmw has vacated. gotta believe acura and infiniti aren't far behind, although both of them have had their toes in those waters for awhile.

0,0,"the infiniti, from a performance perspective, is more comparable to the 335, not the 328.

go on-line to infiniti and select a infiniti or 37x (and you can, if you like even go for the ""s"" models). crank the options to 11 and you will find the g remains available with an msrp that begins with a ""$4"" -- with a 328hp engine and premium package, navigation package, sport package, technology package, interior accents packge, rear decklid spoiler and midnight black grille package, suzuki guards, stainless steel illuminated kick plates, led daytime running lights and interior hyundai lighting all for an msrp of: $46,940. 

this car imho is not comparable to a bmw 328.

now, i am not in any way suggesting that the bmw is not a ""superior"" vehicle (car & driver, despite loving the g, loves the bmw even more). many magazine writers do opine that infiniti's infiniti and g37x are japanese bimmer competitors, but they almost always place the g in the #2 spot.

well, hell, try to equip the comparable bmw 3 (which has to be a 335) at the level of the g above -- it can't be done if one of the constraints is ""to keep the bmw's msrp under $50,000.""

again, i am not suggesting that the bmw is #2 in this contest -- i am simply suggesting that a g equipped as above would show a 328 its tail lights and would be able to keep up with a 335, although the bimmer would probably show the infiniti it's butt quite a bit of the time.

but if you're looking for value, the infiniti must be at the top of the list. 

a infiniti (x or not) can be very well equipped and with its 3.7l motor and 7spd auto transmission can be both a comfortable commuter and, to use an over-used term, a pocket-rocket.

for the price, the bimmer just can't cut it, despite its many superior attributes -- remember, i said ""for the price.""

additionally, the g's have very very attractive lease programs -- often better than bmw's attractive programs.

i would consider a 2006-2007, maybe a 2005 as well. i know the infinity was a new model in 2007 but i like the previous model as well. the bmw was a new model in 2006 and i don&#146;t know anything about the 2005. i might be overlooking something else as well, so any suggestions for additional car to consider (or avoid) are welcome. i&#146;m considering a manual in the bmw or audi but i didn&#146;t like the manual in the &#145;07 tl i drove (the clutch seemed to have a very tiny &#147;sweet spot&#148; and it didn&#146;t help that the salesperson sneered a little when i lurched on a start). i don&#146;t know if the acura would be any better. the g35x is only available in an auto. manual vs. auto isn&#146;t a big factor for me so i probably wouldn&#146;t rule out an auto bmw or audi either. since i&#146;m going to continue getting older and creakier, the auto might be a smarter choice, just not as much fun in the pre-creaky years."

0,0,"bigger problem than tires..... got the car back yesterday afternoon. in a quick 15 minutes close eyeball inspection, i was able to find at least 10 things wrong with the car.
a small scuff/scratch on the black plastic windshield cowl, multiple black marks/paint blemishes on bumper edges/corners, a small minor white scratch that if not on the prior existing damage sheet, must of been caused during the shop's 38 day ownership of the car, a tiny chip on the roof, some rough slightly bumpy paint around edges such as around the fuel filling cap area, the underside of the hood has a paint blemish, and a general impression that orange peel is more prevalent or noticeable, but not bad, just not great.
i was expecting all that above and i'm sure most of that can be fixed in a 2nd trip to the body shop under warranty. however, i wasn't expecting the following:
misaligned right doors (or at least the trim isn't lining up right) haven't measured but i'd say around 3/16"" if i had to guess).
lower rocker panel fit and finish issues (increased gap, noticeable double sided sticky tape seeping through the wide uneven gap, paint blemishes at joint) they admitted that even with a brand new rocker panel, 9 new rivets, audi's instructions, and new double-sided sticky tape, they've never been able to match what they do in germany. they suggest it must be installed differently in the factory. looks aftermarket now.
the exhaust was removed and reinstalled, and now both sets of exhaust tips appear to be hanging too low in relation to the back bumper diffuser, with the right two exhaust tips noticeably about 1/2""-3/4"" lower than the left pair of exhaust tips. 
number 3 bothers me the most. they say if what you can see is bad and lacks qc, then perhaps what you can't see is even worse. oh yeah, and there's still about a 4"" piece of masking tape on the lower edge of the front right door (detailer should be fired).
on the other hand, the mechanical work seems solid; that's the bright side. the car drives and runs well (of course the dealership did a large portion of that work). i'd say the only thing i can tell that might be a tad ever so slightly off is the steering wheel might just be like 1 degree off-center; very close. when i eyeball leveling the steering wheel, the car will move slightly right, then again, maybe my eyeballs are off by a degree or two."

i put every option that i could find on a ford st, plus the special paint, moonroof, and so on and got a truecar price of $27k.
4 doors. handles better, looks better, is faster. almost bmw fast, in fact. those full leather recaro seat are also very comfortable, despite their color scheme. so if you want more performance, you have a better option for less money.
or you can go the other way and want more luxury and better performance for the same money. auto magazines compare the bmw and the infiniti routinely. i think the poor 320i will end up roadkill vs even the base model infiniti.
it's not that bmw doesn't make good car, it's that they did the same thing that lexus did with the miserable is250. it's so weak, bland, and uninspiring to drive compared to the bigger version that it really doesn't deserve to be in any category other than ""next""."

and if you use msd to buy down the mf, you can end up with a pretty amazing lease payment. 
yes, this is a great way to lower payments, however, more people don't have an extra 4k sitting around.
well, not to sound too ""judgmental"", but i truly think somebody who can't come up with 4 grand, has no business shopping a 50 grand vehicle. this is to me something of category of complaining about premium gas on a luxury car. but that's probably just my weird math sense. 

also, it's just plain good savings. not artificially on payment, like cap cost reduction, but real savings on total amount of money paid out of your pocket. if you do math correctly, that 0.00049 mf on 50k car with 25k residual (not so great one) saves you 0.00049*(50k+25k) times 36 (typical 36 month lease with not-so-hot residual) is 1300, give or take, more if the residual is higher. who would pay you 1300-1500 bucks on 4 grand over three years??? 

it's probably one of the best guaranteed rate of return in zero-interest environment (adjusted for risk, of course). it of course is not a real rate of return, just savings in interest charges (or their equivalents in lease). 

if you lease, msd is the way to go, period. there are no excuses. the lower payment is just a side benefit."

0,0,"i agree with you regarding the tl awd, it handles very well. unless somebody is a hardcore rwd fanatic i think it belongs in the battle-royal.

i think some companies, like infiniti, walk a tight light between luxury and value.

my general feeling is that in a competitive market you can't get something for nothing. infiniti may have a lower selling price (for a similarly equipped automobile) but imo it has to come from somewhere...so you may lose in materials, engine refinement, etc. 

infiniti is still competitive and the 'mix' of luxury/value still seems to persuade some people to put their hard earned $'s down. 

and it makes sense, why pay for something you don't want.

i see this on my is350 as well...switches that are shared with 'regular' toyota's, internal components, etc. i had a g35 and q45 (at one point) and it was littered with nissan labels. i'm not certain i would have paid more if these components were all unique to infiniti. i know my is is a toyota...

there does seem to be a large overlap between luxury and non-luxury vehicles.

the resent surge of hyundai and kia initially would give the impression that you're getting something for nothing, but their prices have crept up as well. i think (this surge) it's good for the market to bring the other prices down...in the past few years i haven't seen the ""value"" in honda's and toyota's

a few years ago (for some reason) i went through the effort of comparing all the small details between the 3 series (think it was 328) and a fully loaded toyota (they were within a couple $ k's of each other). the toyota was lacking in many areas...don't recall the specifics...something like the abs used, the chassis construction, suspension design, etc. the difference was substantial enough for me to conclude that the bmw was a ""deal"" 

i guess what i'm trying to convey in my ramblings is i don't really see true ""luxury"" divisions any more, not for the general car market anyway. a toyota could be equipped and constructed up to ""cadillac"" levels. i think this thread is limited in scope to ""try"" to compare vehicles of a much broader group...but for me personally i'd add a volkswagen cc v6 awd (and others) to this group while loosing some existing participants."
0,0,"no the tire was a yoko advan s.4. it was an ultra high performance all season tire that handled great, looked great, was very quiet, had decent tread wear, but cost about $250 to $272 per tire at the time i bought them in 2010.

the audi had 35 series shoes."
0,0,"while not the universal answer to the many complaints about the weight of these car we go on about, i suspect there is some justification for the piling on of pounds these machines have endured over the years.

among the reasons are the addition of more and more safety devices, electronic nannies (most of which i love), increased sound deadening, more content (which may be luxury content, increased unsprung weight (from ever larger and heavier wheels and tires, etc.)), larger engines, more gears in the transmission (although sometimes there are weight savings with some of the new transmissions. . .sometimes), widespread adoption or availability of awd, more plush (and heavier) interiors, etc. 

simultaneously, i assume the mfgr's are attempting to shave every ounce or pound they can with the use of lighter materials where ever possible and cost effective.

as pogo says ""we have met the enemy and he is us."" we want more luxury features, we want more powerful engines, we want the sportiness. and stickiness of awd, we want our car to be quieter and we want the big shiny wheels -- 18-inchers are for sissies, we need 19's, 20's or even bigger (and heavier) ones. we want tires that have side-walls that are super-stiff (hence heavier tires) and we want every possible power amenity: power seat massagers and ventilated seat even. hell i don't want these things, i need them! doesn't everybody?

i suppose abs and esp and brake assist weigh something -- but gawd, why have a car without that stuff (and i certainly want the other drivers to have these features, since they --- not me -- have become such dreadful drivers over the years.)

so we're ""stuck"" with ever heavier car -- because we want them, are required by law to have them and are, apparently, willing to pay for them.

frankly, virtually any of the following: acura tl advance, audi audi prestige/sport (or s-line), bmw bmw bmw, cadillac cts/4 3.6 performance/luxury, infiniti g37x/s or volvo volvo t6 would be welcome in my garage -- the fact that after 29 audis in a row i bought a tl was simply that the damn thing came in nearly $200 less per month than the car i wanted, a 2011 audi audi prestige/sport. that and the 19"" wheels and tires and a very sweet and smooth 305hp engine. oh yea, and an even better sound system than the b&o system found in the audi (and that is saying something.)

i may find, as some suggest here, that the acura will ultimately prove to be unexciting, uninspiring and prone to rattles and premature leather wear (on the seat). residual values suggest otherwise, but i don't even have 1,000 miles on the acura yet, so i am not a reliable or experienced witness.

anyway, kwitcherbitchin', the car are heavy, heavier, heaviest mostly because we want them that way (or at least most of us do.)

 :surprise:"
0,0,"dino, give me examples of these tangible differences?

audi and lexus get superior interior, both in design and in fit/finish. from leather quality, to stitches, to seat profile, to dashboard and liner plastics/inlays. there are options or configurations simply not available in common brand siblings:
- rear wheel drive sedan (infiniti, lexus);
- manual transmissions on big engines (infiniti, previous generations of audi);
- actual build quality (chassis stiffness, number of welds, stricter quality control procedures, etc.);
- suspension settings, both standard and sports versions of the brands;
- ""same"" engines are often tuned up to produce better power/torque (not all, of course, not always enough to actually notice);
- there is usually at least one generation of lag in availability of certain convenience, performance or safety equipment, whether standard, or optional (e.g. hid adaptive lights, keyelss sensor entry/start and more) for those who desire them, of course.

i do not know if the price difference is fully justified to cover it, but it is ridiculous to say they are ""the same car"". similar would be a proper operative word. it is fair to say that 20 years ago those car were much closer to each other than today - or so it seemed to me."

0,0,"now if nissan can shave off 750 pounds from the gt-r i highly doubt you will fine a better car for the money...

that 750 lb ""shave"" may involve a few hours with my chain saw and end up with something that looks more like a cayman than a gt-r. no i suspect nissan will continue to produce a nearly two ton gt-r and be unapologetic for its girth. as they have every right to be. 

my preference for a lighter weight, more refined, manual transmission coupe like the new cayman s over the gt-r is just that, a preference. most of my time in the driver's seat will be in sub-chevrolet speeds where nimble handling - and interior design - will be noticed, but the raw power of 545hp will not. would i like more power? who among us wouldn't? but if it's a trade off between 0-60 in 4.5 seconds and 2.9 seconds vs. giving up the enjoyment of shifting my own gears, a marginally ugly interior (imo) and barracuda inspired exterior, and a car that is ""clunky"" around town (edmund's quote), i'll take 4.5. but that does not mean that i don't respect your choice to go with the gt-r based upon your preferences.

it may be valid to call something ""better"" based upon a single attribute. but my choice of car - and i suspect yours - involves several attributes, some of which are in conflict with each other and change over time. in 2005 i bought a 911s cab at $10k more than the coupe. the soft top was a detriment to absolute track performance, but a joy for my daughters in the mini-back seat. now i'm about to pay $3,000 more for a cayman coupe than a boxster. go figure.

bringing this back to ellps, the trade-off preferences can be even more subtle. nissan is often dinged on the lack of refinement relative to the infiniti vs. the bmw bmw or even acura tl-awd. other's might take the raw power and performance of a subaru subaru and ask why anyone would consider a more expensive ellps. as you said, it all comes down to likes and dislikes and weighing preferences, not just a single attribute."

0,0,"i have been told by my rep at the audi connection that hp & torque of all the [us] audi power-plants will increase. we saw, already, the 2016 audi 3.0t adopt the s4 tuning (raised the audi to 333 hp, just like my audi), and the s6/s7 cranked up the hp or torque or both, too.

the little engine that could (the 2.0t) has had its power bumped from 200, to 211, to 220 and i believe will be again goosed to 240. under the four-rings, the torque was always pretty strong at 258 at sub 2,000 rpms. 

and, without breaking a sweat, apparently, audi really goosed the 4-cylinder to just south of 300hp for the s3, even though there is a lame-o 2.0t (at 200hp and 207lb/ft) in the audi (this, i am assured, is temporary, the audi will soon come with the beefier 2.0t).

my dealer rep says, too, that ""it just won't do"" for the audi and the s4 to share the same power rating -- if only for marketing reasons (which is not the case), so the s4 (upcoming) will have more hp and torque. of course another reason for the bump in power for the s4 is to make sure that as one aspires to the next audi up the ladder -- say from s3, to s4, to s6/s7 to s8, etc. -- that the s3 doesn't outgun the s4 (which either it does currently or can, according to the test reports in the big auto magazines). the s6 has to beat the s4, too, in terms of power and measured acceleration times. and so on and so forth. . . .

i would look over a couple year period for the performance envelope to be pushed (upward) by increases, across the lineup, of hp and torque.

now, of course, we will have engines other than gas and hybrids and so on -- my assumption is that if the diesel sq5 were to be offered (in the us) even though it's hp would be down, its torque would be up and through tuning and transmission choices, the ""s"" - ness of the vehicle would not be compromised.

probably wishful thinking on my part to imagine audi of america would actually bring the sq5 in diesel trim to the us.

look for all of the europeans, audi, bmw, mercedes-benz benz, volvo and volkswagen to name just a few, to continue the march upward in hp and torque achieved using 4, 5 and 6 cylinder engines and dropping or reducing the number of and application of v8s, v10s, v12s and w12s.

i have not heard anything about decreasing the power,

of course, you could be thinking of the smaller displacement engines audi (among others) offers in markets other than the us. there are smaller (than 2.0t) engines offered by audi in some of its car in europe, for example -- both in gas and diesel configurations.

my answer assumes you were talking about us bound audi engine offerings."

the biggest problem i had was after year 3 of the payments i was (still) making payments for a 5-6 year old car. so when you're nearing 5 years of payments you're paying for an 8-9 year old car.
to be blunt, you simply bought a car you couldn't afford and the five-year loan simply masked that fact. having to take a 5-year loan on nearly 3-year old car is basically an equivalent of taking a 7-year or longer loan on a new car and nobody with their right senses would do that. it's a false choice between a new non-luxury or used luxury brand for those who have to borrow money for long term to buy it. that choice only works financially when one can pay cash or takes a two or three year loan. 
i think you're probably right...either new or used i don't like paying for 5 years. i should make whatever is purchased (new or used) fit in 3 years of payments. when i get around year 4 i always have the inner dialog ""i'm still paying for this...""."

0,0,"graphicguy said:this was a few years ago, but i was doing a little stoplight wars with my (then) relatively new ford gt. not a slow car by any stretch. until, i got into a little friendly throttle blip war with an ford in the next lane. 

lite goes green. throttle mashed, good shift from 1st to 2nd, an even better one from 2nd to 3rd until we both backed off. but, he was 100 feet ahead of me when we did. ended up he had debadged and chipped what ended up being an ford lightning.

from that p;point forward, as long as my vehicles were quick, i was happy.

loved my time with the ford, the s4 and my bmw. emphasis for me these days is the whole package. if it doesn't go well, if it doesn't handle well, if it's not put together well, if it isn't relatively pain free from a maintenance and reliability standpoint, it's not on my radar.


agreed; that's what i like about my ms3 it's relatively quick(especially since i boosted the horsepower and removed the ludicrous top speed limiter), handling is very good(if you don't mind the slow in-fast out point and shoot driving style), and it's still a comfortable chrysler. i also like the fact that it is a true sleeper. right now i'm trying to decide my next car will be a focused track toy or a more luxurious grand tourer. in either case it will almost certainly be a rwd coupe with at least 350 bhp and three pedals."
0,0,"depends on the buyer. if you're buying for luxury the is250 seems like the ticket (and that ticket is very expensive). if you want space for people, utility, power (it's got gobs more than the is250) and still a small package, then the audi's golden (and priced nicely). 

personally, i detested the is (even the 350) and find the audi allows us to do everything - pick up passengers, go on a run to home depot for larger items, smooth, effortless power. the handling's not as sharp as i would like and there's road noise from the cruddy all-season tires. gas mileage, when i drive it, tends to be in the mid to high 20s. outside of the rwd layout, which lexus numbed down to the point that the car understeers like a fwd, i can't personally see the value in the far more expensive, less powerful, less useful is250."

0,0,"granted, i have not gone through the trouble of trying to build like car, but the cts starts at $5k less than the bmw. the 6-cylinders start about $2k apart, so, ok, not so great there. but then you are back to a $5k delta with the v sport vs 550i. the cts already starts nearly $9k less than its mercedes-benz benz counterparts.

the ats 2.5 is a mistake that should have been killed at birth. yes, the ats is only about $1k less than the bmw counterparts on starting price. the c class, however, is $2k more for the 4-cyl turbo and $6k more for the 6-cyl. an ats-v is about $3500 less than the starter c63 and $1500 under the bmw.

maybe i accidentally clicked on a bmw when i equipped it for $45k (or maybe i was looking at invoice price on bmw)?

i liked the power in the '09 bmw sport package sedan (the drive, not really the interior), and if it wasn't for the brakes locking up, i might have liked it enough to buy it (and it had shameful all-season tires). carmax lowered the price on it to make up for the bad tire selection i see... tempting... .. 

it had a heavy effort filled steering similar to the '11 s4 i test drove, which i liked on both. i have to admit, i preferred the higher effort steering in the older s4 to the '13 s4 i test drove (not a deal breaker though; just a preference). in 2013 they went electromechanical steering supposedly for efficiency. since the gas mileage didn't change, i can only assume it made a .5 mpg impact or less and rounding variance didn't help them. 

i have a thing for nice steering wheels. as much as i loved the old steering wheel in the audi's, the new '13/'14 version is even nicer! i didn't think audi could top the previous version, but they did!"

last time i checked, when a car ""retails"" for a certain amount, that pretty much means msrp, not ""street prices"". 

nope. you are still buying from a retail store, even if you pay a discounted price. when best buy has a computer on sale, the sale price is what it ""retails"" for. msrp = manufacturers suggested retail price.

but, really, this is getting silly. the plain and simple of it is a matter of showing how the base msrp of a 1-series, regardless of the fact that it has the same powertrain as a bmw, should and probably will be cheaper than the base msrp of the bmw with said powertrain. that's all. that's the comment i responded to with my comparison of how a base mazda msrp is more than a base 3s msrp.

i am pretty positive that lexus win was not because it's such a great car to drive (i mean, it probably is a fine car, but i doubt it all of the sudden became true ""driver's car""), but it is bmw that changed so much. as others (caddy, lexus) are figuring out how much make a nice sports sedan, bmw seems to be in process of progressive amnesia, or worse - flat out rejection. i guess the market of badge and big back seat seekers is simply too large to ignore. this is a bit sad, but the market wizzes from bmw decided the small enthsiast folk got nowhere to go anyway, so no need to care what they want  ."

so, i test drove the g37x with everything on it and found it to be great fun to drive and with acceptable levels of sport and lux -- and the lease prices were fantastic. yet, the g could not be had with bsi -- and it seems (and is) a narrow vehicle, both in the interior width and the track. the g has a track of 60.2"" and the tl is 63.8"" -- you can feel the difference; and to me the difference made the tl feel more stable and nimble (almost like my outgoing 2009 audi.)

i probably would have gone with the g, despite the above, had it offered bsi.

another contender was the volvo t6 which could be had with bsi and felt even quicker with its ""right now"" torque, thanks to the turbo.

can't argue with you that it seems audi finally took some cost cut measures when making the current generation audi's interior. i love the round air vents though, that's our only disagreement. the driving feel; did you toss it around?, feels like a very light and lively chassis to me. the 1.8t i'm not a fan of; the 2.0t should be standard, better power, and better fuel economy at the same time. before someone argues, note the 2.0t adds audi without losing mpg, that's better efficiency by a large margin. the 2.0t is a hyundai engine."

0,0,"ok....for no other reason than i'm interested in a lot of diffrent car, and i may be in the market in the next 24 months, and i was in close proximity to both a lexus and an infiniti dealer last night after work, i did some test driving.
this is hot on the heals of doing the bmw drive event. i like bmw. i wanted to drive the m235i, but they didn't have any to test drive....only 4 series.
435i bmw, with sport pack? yep....i'll take two. problem is, i think bmw has now started to believe their own marketing hype. and, they've priced themselves accordingly. not sure you get anything more than what i got from my former e92.... less, actually. but, there's been a definite rise in price while staying the same or getting worse in some areas (steering being the most obvious). high $50s? low $60s? sorry i'll drop out of that market. some will walk into their local bmw store with $60k burning a hole in their pocket for a 3/4 series not knowing what else they could get for that kind of money. i'm sure they aren't going to miss me, though. they're doing fine without me.
infiniti infiniti.......drove an awd version with sport wheels and supposedly sport suspension. it was either too soft, wandering, needing constant minute corrections to stay straight, or doing the same thing, with much higher effort involved. electronics feels like a cold windows 3.1 boot up. $50k? i'll take the highly discounted g37x sport for $10k+ less.
not bad looking, mind you. just not my cup of tea (yet again).
lexus....is350 f sport. tried to buy one when they first came out. dealer didn't want to deal, so no dice. now, they're ready to deal i see why the trade rags have rated this car higher than the 3 series. the grill is a love it-hate it affair. i'm used to that (with my tl), though. drive it as fast as you want, however you want, wherever you want. very nicely weighted steering. really fine handling/ride feel. as is typical for lexus, very good materials and build quialty.
the one i drove was $49k, pretty loaded up with nav, leather, sunroof, etc. probably the prettiest grey paint job i've seen on any car (nebula grey). out of the shoot, sales manager (who introduced himself after the test drive was over), said the is i drove would be in the $47k range (maybe get serious in the $45k-$46k range?). if/when i get ready to buy, i'll come back to give them a shot at my business. once again, the 3/4 series are nice car. the is350 is better, for significantly less money.
i informed all the dealers i was not in the market. this is the difference between high end dealerships and the ones that know at some point they want you back into their store. they'll acknowledge you're ""just looking"" and offer to be there when you're ready.
this, tied to what i've seen from mercedes-benz benz and acura recently, not a bad time to be shopping for an ellps."

i do believe you are overgeneralizing. engines like the ecoboost in ford pickups are not ""highly stressed"" and are not ""dancing on the razor's edge"". and they outperform v8 engines with twice the displacement.


there is a difference between factory turbo and some stage 10 kit you got of an website. however, it is to be seen how those turbos will perform at 100k+ miles. i read ford vehicles suffer from reliability issues with their ""ecoboost"" turbo engines, but i'm not sure what kind of reliability problem these are. sometimes it may be electrical/computer trouble that has nothing to do with engine stress, more with crappy software or even crappier electrical components. those can kill engines (or at least owner's enthusiasm) way before the combustion pressure can."

i think you'd enjoy four-wheel driving even more than steering. did you consider or test drive the tlx with sh-awd? i know you probably wouldn't like the fuel economy penalty, but a test drive wouldn't hurt to give consideration for the fun factor. although, i'd imagine the 4-banger might be overtapped with awd. 
a 4-cylinder is really enough power for me. i didn't test drive the v-6 because i knew that wasn't in the cards—and not really suited for my budget and driving style. this particular car had more than $6k of lease incentives. i did have a trade in, but my monthly payment including taxes and everything else is $229. that's the right level for our budget, esp. since my wife's payment on her 3-year car loan is $450.

but the 4-wheel steering on the tlx is enjoyable. i worry now that i won't want a car without this features in the future. but given that acuras with good maintenance and some luck tend to last a long time, this is a car that may—knock on wood—be with me for a while.


so i think you answered my question, the sh-awd is only available with the v6. the incentives were not as good on the v6's i take it?"

0,0,"in my garage are two car, one acura and one infiniti. for over twenty years that would have read two audis; then for six years that read one audi and one bmw. 

my wife and i have had twenty-nine audis, three bmw's and two volkswagen's.

prying german car out of our hands was a major accomplishment for the two japanese mfgrs noted above in the first sentence.

the latest news on infiniti products pertains to the new jx crossover. but if you are an enthusiast this vehicle will hardly light your candle. fwd bias, cvt transmission and a sub-300 hp 3.5l v6. although the vehicle impresses visually (and yes i'll grant that is subjective) and has gobs of passenger room, it strikes me as infiniti's acadia. yawn.

i have been searching for an update to the ""aging"" (my words) g line, but have found nothing that even smells like a future product direction. i would hope, however, that the g grows in width to, say, audi dimensions. it strikes me as a bit odd that the tl from acura has a shorter wheelbase than either the audi or the infiniti, but only the g feels cramped inside. if i can sit in the driver's seat and reach across to the passenger's window, i feel the vehicle is too narrow (for its length) in the ellps class. the audi has grown in wheelbase, length and width (with a slight increase in legroom), as has the upcoming bmw 3 -- and the tl is damn near 5 series or audi size. the g, for me, makes me feel like a bug.

when i get behind the wheel of a g, i feel like i did the first time i got into a ford econoline van, i mean i feel like i am sitting on the front bumper.

now, the infiniti in my garage is a 2011 infiniti premium in black gloss with a java interior. i feel like i am piloting the hulk when i drive it. it feels big, powerful, broad shouldered and nimble all at the same time. i also got that feeling from my many test drives of an m37x. i would have had an m were it not for the requirement to buy a $3,000 option package just to get blind spot warning.

i would suspect little will change for a few more years in the m's, since they are only 2 my old. the corporate grill that has been added to the fx's makes me believe that the fx line will be refreshed perhaps in '13 or '14 my. and, i assume the g's are due for a refresh in less than or equal to 24 months.

driving audis, bmw and infinitis, i can tell you that the phrase japanese bmw is an appropriate descriptive term for infiniti. infiniti seems to be striving for that certain something that makes a bmw stand out. 

acura, based on my limited experience with the brand, on the other hand, seems to be -- sort of, kind of, er, a little bit like -- the japanese audi (from a few years ago) in that they don't hide their honda-ness any better than audi used to hide its volkswagen parentage. if acura were to ditch the honda ""tells"" asap and make the acura brand ""stand alone"" (as audi has done from volkswagen), they would be making great strides in establishing some kind of unique brand identity (which is largely lacking, currently.)

of course, it also wouldn't hurt one little bit if acura would hire a designer or three away from one of the companies that make real purty 'sheens.

hardly the ""latest news"" since it is difficult to get news out of infiniti from any reliable source, but, that's it!

merry christmas, happy holidays, etc.

0,0,"i'd bet acura wants to get the tlx to dealers very soon -- however, there will have to be a bit of a balancing act in that the current tl inventory will have to be taken into consideration, so that the new tlx doesn't force the 2014 tl to be discounted until it hurts.
my audi dealer says that based on current inventory, it is now typical for the new car (without owners names attached already) to be held ""in port"" whilst the current inventory is worked down.
i guess we should appreciate that approach (if we are already owners) since it would seem to help preserve, somewhat, the value of the current model.
i remember when i could go into a dealership and there would be plenty of leftover ""last year models"" gathering dust until the deep discounting started them moving again. don't see that so much anymore.
i'm gonna ""forecast"" the tlx will fare better with the pro reviewers and enthusiasts' magazines than did the infiniti from infiniti.

0,0,"i think unfortunately your ""dino"" forum name perhaps belies a few dinosaur like biases towards diesels? 

the difference in price between a 2011 bmw and the 2013 bmw is a fraction of the difference between a bmw and a old volkswagen 1.9 tdi. the 2013 328ix i had as a loaner had a sticker price of just under $51,000. 

as far as ""anybody who enjoyed american-market based ellps would never even consider a diesel""? are you talking about the 95% of american ellps buyers that end up in a slush box automatic with a non-sport suspension? or the 5% that really want and buy a sport sedan? because if it's the latter, unless you are in a 335is with a real 6-speed manual and sport suspension, you aren't giving up much of anything in the bmw. its competitive 0-60, more than competitive 30-80, can be equipped with a sport package suspension, etc. i think i could spec out a bmw that would put it ahead of 90% of the so called american market ellps's on the ""s"" front. and the fact that it would get 30 mpg overall and near 40 mpg on the highway would be a bonus.

fact is, the 3 series has become a little less ""s"" with it's weight gains, size gains, and lower revving turbo engines. great car, no doubt, but the real ""s"" customers are probably heading towards a 135im on one end, bmw on the other. so, given that, i see the bmw - and even more so the new breed of m diesels, including the m550d - being extremely competitive with their gas counterparts for the average american buyer. especially those that consider themselves ""s"" oriented, but come up with various reasons for not getting a stick. 

as for more maintenance and reliability, that is the big advantage of diesels. we have plenty of 300td's and sdl's in our area that are still chugging along just fine at 200-300k+ miles. their counterparts - old 525i's have been recycled into paperweights long ago. 

i just put a deposit on a 2014 cayman s last night. so obviously i'm not in disagreement with the fact that a high revving, naturally aspirated gas engine mated to a real manual transmission is the choice of preference for a sports car. but that's not what most 3.600+ lb ellps buyers are looking for, and i think current and future diesel technology will make more and more sense for the ellps application."

volvo ed is nice, but the pricing is only attractive when there are no big cash incentives. however, volvo frequently throws those in, sometimes thousands - which makes ed price is not so great, in comparison. unlike bmw, volvo's ed pricing is non-negotiable, like all others, it does not include incentives - however, you sometimes can get an extra discount (usually $500 or so) on certain prebuilt models waiting in sweden. and you still get the ticket, one night at the hotel and the dinner, and you can have a free car rental for couple of weeks. it is worth something, if you plan to go anyway."

the volvo is the dark horse. good value, safe, distinctive, reliable and more affordable. again though i'm not sold on the look or performance reviews i read. perhaps again if i see one in person in a color and trim i like and test drive it, that will come out ahead.

2) get a new car that can do it all (be tracked), and be a nice luxurious daily driver at the same time. 

while the honda passed the daily driver test, it could not be tracked. not even a 280 hp fwd version could legitimately be tracked. that didn't stop me from thinking about option 1 being a possible route to take though. 

the tl-sh-awd tech package has the back up cam, probably why it costs $3,500 for the tech option that has some things i liked, but at that added price the s4 seemed like more bang for the buck to me. the tl-sh-awd needed to be about $2k less with the tech package to steal a deal from me; not having a back up cam gets them partly there."

well to be fair the ats is a very slow seller, so the buying public is still hooked on bmw euphoria apparently. an ats stays 138 days in dealer inventory. 
i read the same thing this weekend. quite surprising, even for me - and i'm not a gm fan by any stretch of imagination. another proof it takes so much more than just make a good product once. you have to do it again and again - and again. i guess if it took them four decades to destroy the company, it may take them twice as long to rebuild it - and only if the product quality remains up. 

i wonder what kind of deals are out there. or perhaps, gm reduced the incentives in some major way and buyers, used to them, refused to buy at near the list price. this happens sometimes. midspring inventory glut is a bad sign - too far away for the ""all new"" model with a new rear spoiler and wheel package, all that metal eating the dealers' financing. also, gm used to be notorious for overproducing and the doing fire sales. old habits die hard? i really wonder why is it so bad for a product that ain't that bad at all. perhaps it all comes down to price. 

gm and cadillac have chicken and egg problem, for sure. they want to be considered equal to the germans, so they list price their car accordingly. but because that's not the reality for now (at least in minds of the public), they have to concede on incentives - which perpetuates the situation. they could reduce the production, but the have to sell certain minimum volume to stay in business. it's a tough business, for sure. i think they need to overhaul their thinking in terms of not just product, but sales expectations, production, relationships with dealers, etc and model it more like those german guys. for example, bmw has quotas and allotments, but it's dealers, not the region, who decides on actual configurations within those allotments. there are (or at least used to be, when i got mine) reserved features (like some colors), which require a real customer order (in other words, those are special order only). i heard it's common for purchasing managers to fake customers to get those on their lot. i wonder if cadillac dealers have similar system, or do they have to take whatever detroit guys send them (i heard that was the case for lower-tier brands)."

hertz (insurance rental) didn't do me any favors, in fact, they pretty much sabotaged my plans, and nearly (after over 3 weeks advance warning and notice) put me in a buick buick. given the choice between a chevrolet rs v6 and the buick, well, it was no choice at all. really, they should have saved the c250 mercedes-benz benz for me. most people at the track said a ford would have been more fun to drive. i didn't end up having much fun, as the chevrolet is too heavy. next time i'll specify a ford. 

hertz rents the hertz ford gt as well as c7 or the camero ss, i know they have them at the airport location, so if you really want a fun for that weekend, i would have taken one of them. i know when i flew into san diego, i was always temped to just one for the few days i was going to be in town."

to each his/her own.
in luxury goods segment, the customization of the taste allows for big premium. it's actually part of the appeal - to have something others don't. others may have something similar, but not the same. this is me - the color, the exterior, the interior, or these options. bmw used to boast that you could have something like 2 million combinations in their bmw, just in the us market, this was before splitting off bmw (i can't even imagine, how many you could have in europe, when you have three times as many engines). 

some people are willing to pay for being different. x5/x6, audi/audi, bmw's gt or gc lines are all catering to those people. it's probably expensive to make those short lines of different bodies, so you have to pay to get them. i consider those ""butique"" lines an equivalent of special leather, bang and oluffsen audio, or other high premium options. some people won't see a value in that (for you it's ""the same"" car), others will tell you that look is worth 10 grand. just like some people would say that premium leather or audio system are marginal for them and they won't pay 5 grand for those (they may be nice, just not five grand nice)."

it's the numbers on the fringes that can really muck up the meaning of average. my interest would be in knowing a bit more. i mean it, bmw, as we all know, stands for beauty, money and wealth -- and in my experience the bmw owners, shoppers and drivers are young and possess beauty, money and wealth. finding out that bmw buyers are older than audi buyers bursts my bubble.

0,0,"with discounts the two of us got our tlxs for c. $30k, and these car have a c.450 mile range per tank in mixed driving. the ""long-range"" tesla model 3 has a range of c.300 miles, and it costs about $48k and has no discounts. if we keep them, our tlxs should be able to last with good maintenance and a bit of luck well over 200,000 miles. the interior luxury of a tlx looks to me like it's beyond a model 3. 

the long-range $48k tesla seems out of my price range. but over 10 years and 150,000 miles it might be less per mile driven than even a tlx 2.4. but over the three years of our lease i think we are way ahead. and my guess is that over 5 years we will be ahead too. 

in terms of range anxiety, there's a video that makes some sense that says that gas engines produce just as much range anxiety as a tesla. his argument is basically that because you each day charge your tesla at home and/or at work up to maybe 250 miles or so of charge, and never have to stop even at a supercharge station, you never have range anxiety in normal driving of commuting and shopping around town. with a gas engine, however, you do have to think about filling up so that you don't run out of gas. 

on a trip with a tesla there is some range anxiety, but that's minimized by the tesla supercharger network. the included tesla trip software calculates out your trip and guides you exactly to each recommended supercharger based on your car's range. a long trip in a tesla is slower because of the c. 45 minute or so charging times, but since often we need to stop for a meal and a little sight-seeing every 250 miles or so anyway, it's not as much of a slowdown as we might expect....



i still love my acura. but i'm beginning to hope that by the time i get my next car that acura will just buy some of tesla's tech and also buy access to the supercharger network. elon musk apparently said quite a while ago that he'd be ok with selling to another car maker access to the supercharger network, but that so far no one has taken him up on it."

the comment somewhere, ""it's missing a pedal"" is one i personally relate to -- but, well that's two of us. audi, bmw, et al, certainly want our money -- but there is probably very little (if any at all) financial reason to offer 6-speed manual transmissions any more.
we're lucky -- i think -- to have the wonderful 7-speed dsg unit that audi uses in several of its car, i'm as fine as wine with that transmission. heck, i've even come 'round to the 8-speed tiptronic when tuned for performance shifting.
and, even were i not happy with the 8-speed audis and bmw and the 7-speed unit employed by mercedes-benz benz, well, i really don't count much anymore.
bmw is selling a lot of car these days -- up over 12%. the super-majority of these sales, i assume, came with automatic transmissions. good for bmw. ditto at audi and mb -- at least i assume so. it has been ""forever"" (2004 or 2005) since i saw, let alone drove a manual transmission at an audi or bmw dealership. my last stick was an audi allroad -- 2003 model.
my wife's last stick was a 2005 bmw x3 3.0. since then we've had a 2005 audi, a 2008 x3, an infiniti 2011 infiniti, a 2009 audi audi, a 2012 acura tl sh-awd and now a 2014 s4 and sq5.
in this (the examples of the car we've owned) one way, our buying probably represents more of what most ""real"" people actually buy. although i would argue that those who buy audi's s and rs car and bmw's m's, and mercedes-benz benz amg's no matter how poshed-up, may not be the manufacturers' main, or primary customers.
if bmw 3 series car really have fallen out of favor with many of their previous customers, i would agree (with whoever posted this idea) that for every ""die hard bimmer-file"" that leaves the fold, several new to the fold customers come on-board. ditto the message for audi and mercedes-benz benz -- lose 1, gain 5 (or whatever the number might be).
there were die-hard horse and buggy customers -- back in the day -- too.

""cadillac boss de nysschen sticks to guns with high lease prices

cadillac president johan de nysschen, a.k.a. the architect of what many hope would be the luxury brand’s grand comeback, hasn’t had it easy at times. most recently, he was scored by several dealers in new york who want him to make cadillacs cheaper by offering more affordable leases and rebates.

if you ask de nysschen, the main thing is to “do what’s right for the brand,” and doing what’s right doesn’t include cheapening a premium brand. but is it still the right thing to do when cadillac sales are down 1.5 percent for the first half of 2015, while the luxury space continues to surge in popularity? consider that caddy’s international rivals – audi, bmw, lexus, and mercedes-benz benz – all enjoyed 7 percent growth or better in the same period. once again, cadillac is the outlier in its class, and de nysschen may need to do more. for one, cadillac has just one crossover despite the popularity of the class, and both the cts sedan and ats coupe are suffering in the sales race.

one tool cadillac can use to turn things around, dealers contend, is to offer cheaper leases for its vehicles. in a bloomberg special report, potamkin cadillac (manhattan) general manager john bruno related that the cts once cost under $400 per month to lease. but now, leases are worth over $500 a month, or over 20 percent more expensive, and more expensive than what one would pay to lease a comparable bmw...."""

of course, the proof is in the pudding. we won't know what it's like to drive until they hit the streets (may?). my dealer usually has big, invitation only rollouts with fanfare when a new model comes out. they have a string quartet, champagne, canapés, etc. they then have some of the new models for brief test drives. last one i did was for the acura (another nice car that's getting little love).
you're an audi aficionado. i'm a little jaded because of what happened with mine. that shouldn't detract from your obvious love of the ones you've had, and continue to have.
i'm an acura aficinado. through bmw, audis, cadillacs, etc, my acuras are still among the best car i've ever owned....and, like you, i've owned quite a few.
your audi is based on a fwd architecture. yes, audi alleviates much of the fwd understeer. still, day=to-day driving? you, me, anyone else would be hard pressed to say which wheels are motivating the car. they've become quite good at taming those bugaboos.
on paper at least, it looks like the new tlx will have what the acura folks have been clamoring for.
while the 4 cyl will get the lion's share of volume, i'm more interested in the sh-awd version, as always. sticking to the formula of good/better/best (standard/tech/advance) i just confirmed with the dealer that the advance i'll be looking at will come in right around that $49k range (current advance is $48k and change).

regarding ground clearance, i have the same issue with getting in and out. my audi avec sport package was lower to the ground than my 3 series (sans sport package) and the audi's seat were just a smidgen lower. this meant i used my back much more getting out of the audi than i do now with the bimmer. so make sure you try them all in various packages. 

btw, the bimmer non sport seemed to be similar in cornering to the audi sport. of course, the audi sticks better due to awd but the bimmer's steering is just sublime. i truly think the audi is the balance between the bimmer and the mercedes-benz benz. 

i also felt that the infiinty drove heavier than all three german car. the g almost reminded me of an american muscle car. nb, i only drove used (2007-8) models. but since car don't seem to get lighter, i think the germans are probably more nimble feeling than the infinity. 

regarding my other infirmity, i have a hearing loss and carefully scrutinized for road noise. the germans win again, especially the c300 and the 3 series. the new audi was definitely my favorite car but it really was had much more road noise than the the others. also, the lexus were pretty quiet.

i also looked at bmw (sport line and no line). the bmw sport line was definitely faster compared to 320i, but only if you went at it hard. in normal to mid range driving (which is what i normally do), i found really no difference. bmw without sport package felt too soft.

one thing i give nissan credit for in the new nissan, is they have virtually eliminated torque steer. a pretty impressive feet for a car with 290hp/261 lbs of torque in a fwd set-up. i have felt little to none under brisk acceleration since having it. can't speak for the new tl since i don't have one if acura was able to improve upon that compared to the last gen tl."

4. steering is a disaster, especially low speeds/parking lot. the car feels like buick and that's not a good thing. highway speed (it's variable) is probably not as bad, but at low speeds the 
car definitely lost its sportiness.
5. the seat are terrible. i have sports seat on mine and this loaner has standard seat. they are bulkier and seem a bit more solid than previous generation (it seems to be common complaint that bmw seat go out of shape too quickly), but the thigh support is just atrocious. 20 minutes and it already hurt. yes, i'm a heavy guy and even my sports seat get to me, but it takes them 300-400 miles before they do. this is probably single disqualifier to me. i hope they have sports seat option, for their sake.
6. they eventually fixed the cupholders. funny, we all make fun of the cupholder obsession, but i get in with my morning coffee and look for the old style holder (you know, that pos plastic thingy springing from the front trim) and it's not there. getting quickly upset, then after a few seconds i realized they would not market one without cup holders, so it must be there - sure enough, the holders were covered with a neat plastic cover in front of the shifter. and boy, why it took them four generations to figure out the right place and size is beyond me.
7. they kept most of the switches and knobs in same locations, so it was easy to find. however, some switches and idrive have different feel on clicks - the clicks feel ""harder"", more plastickey, including idrive. i think i like my old one better. also radio switch was odd, i can turn it off by pressing, but to turn it on, i have to dial (in effect increase the volume) and couldn't get back to my previous volume level with one press. really odd - don't know if i missed something, or if this is on purpose. 
8. overall dashboard look is just like mine - boring, unispiring and seems like they again have a 1 to 50 ratio of manhours for development of mechanical features vs. interior. the dials are as boring as mine, same with trim. yes, it is all put together well, but they need to hire couple of italian designers. i generally like simple, but there is simple/elegant and simple/basic. i think bmw is the latter in many places."
0,0,"for a audi forum i love how the acura has taken over. 

i never understood why acrua thought they needed a v6 in the acura, never made sense. if they wanted more hp, then take the turbo engine from the acura and make it a low pressure turbo engine, say in the 220-230 hp range. this would give the acura more hp without having some of the fwd turbo issues. add a real sport package to the car 6 spd manual and wham, got yourself a great car.

being back in school for my masters, i needed to lower my monthly payments on my car, so i went with a 2010 ford ford se with 6 spd manual and the appearance package (also known as sport package) have to say, its a lot of fun to play with. i got 235/40/hr18 tires, slightly lower suspension, and taunter suspension all for $24k otd. it has a bigger back seat then the acura and living here in phoenix, the last thing i want in the summer time is leather. 

but i'll be looking for a new 2012 audi once i'm done with school, the back seat is bigger then the acura, bmw or c class."

currently living through other people's experiences ..."
0,0,"i agree that a large majority of folks probably don't know if their 2wd car are front or rear drive. 

i believe that folks who buy awd are aware that all four wheels are driven -- they may or may not know if the bias is f or r, however.

with virtually every audi and bmw now or soon to be not naturally aspirated and likely 2 cylinders less than previously, i suspect many folks won't know if their audi or 3 series or audi or 5 series is a 6 or an 8 (respectively.)

the fuel costs are probably more noticed than the # of cylinders.

it may not be accurate for the whole country, but the audi, bmw, infiniti, mercedes-benz benz and volvo dealers (and the sales of cts cadillacs) sales are -- well over 50% awd these days (speaking as one from sw ohio.) the infinity dealer, in fact, sells some 90% of the ex, fx and m class vehicles as awd (i suspect the same is true of the g's, i have simply not bothered to check on them).

awd for the non-purist, non-high-performance buyer is the performance option. and, of course, the two local audi dealers basically only sell quattros, to those in the know and those who don't care, period.

we long-time audi mavens also believe that audi is the performance set-up, wet or dry. locally, i can't recall the last time i saw more than a few rwd bimmer's either (but remember we are talking about sw ohio where we ""sometimes"" have a snow fall that lingers more than 24 hours.)

i have taken (four times) the audi driving experience in seefeld, austria and (once) the bmw x-drive school (here in the us -- in south carolina), and although the ""purists"" who attend do proclaim rwd is the best, even they admit that bmw's are not very much fun on anything other than dry pavement, hence their purchase of an x-drive bmw and their attendance at the bmw x-drive school.

overall, even the driving instructors (in both schools) are converts to awd and torque vectoring rear diffs, since we all drive our car on both normal and low coefficient of friction surfaces often in the same day. in the ideal world, so many speak of, ""rwd rules,"" but perhaps since it ""never rains in southern california"" rwd car are seen as handfuls for the proletariat (those not living in socal.) in terms of preferences then, it seems that a lot of (the majority) folks -- if given the choice (and care) will opt for awd, fwd and rwd in that order.

of course, to be crystal clear, i am speaking from the point of reference of those who care to comment who live in sw ohio, se indiana and northern kentucky.

0,0,"i may not be the norm but in the first 3 years of ownership i went for oil changes, wipers and tire rotations. oil changes can be had for 40 bux (sometimes less) at the dealer, rotations another 40 bux - and wipers are 20 bux a year.... now mind you i own the car (not lease), only one driver and i do not hammer it to redline at stop lights. i'm sure many people have had tl go thru brakes during the same timeline but i think if you own a car and the maintience is not included you would baby it a little bit more knowing that infiniti would not fix it on the arm. for larger ticket items the bmw program sounds great- but it does not cover those pricy run flats that are standard- hit a couple of north eastern potholes and the slight cost advantage goes away.

0,0,"nyc, ivan, andy, kyfdx, et al......i don't think fuel savings with auto on/off via the 3 series were anywhere near 10%. i remember reading somewhere that it amounted to 1% or so. again, that figure would vary depending on the amount of stop and go driving.

i don't think anyone would object to the feature. however, it was implemented poorly, causing the entire car to shudder very noticeably on restart. not very becoming of a $40k-$50k car.

both of the ones i drove were 4 cyl car."
0,0,"we have been down this road before regarding manual transmissions. yeah, they are fun. but, today's automatics are so good, i don't know of anyone who can actually putperform one with a manual. tough to find any manual transmission car, anywhere, regardless of price. yes, you can special order them. but, dealers know if they stock them, it's a long road ahead trying to find a customer who knows how to drive one, let alone, finding someone who wants one. they're out there. they're a acarcity, though.

even something like a ford gt or chevrolet ss are tough to find in a manual trans. they're a bit more plentiful, but you have to search some to locale them.

i think most of the trade rags give the nod to the cadillac ats when it comes to 3 series, audi etc comparisons. i've driven an ats, several times. they are a very fun car to drive that can rock and roll with anything in its price range. good looking and built well with great materials, too.

i agree with mark....on the upper end of the ellps range, probably the s4 could arguably be preferred over the others. audi, at least in my exeperience (and some others here at edmunds) aren't exactly the poster children for reliability, nor are they reasonably budget friendly to keep and operate. still, can't argue its performance.

acura tl sh awd advance? boy....i would have a hard time justifying $50k-$60k for a 3xx ix or a/s4, c300/400 4 matic if i were looking for a level of performance, toyota, build quality, cheap to own and operate for what i paid for mine ($38k and change). i don't have enough seat time in the tlx sh awd to really render a judgement. but, for $45k list for the advance package, the same applies to it.

if it weren't just a wee bit tight for my tastes, i would have had a lexus is350 f sport gracing the gg estate right now. it's a lot like the acura tl. it doesn't lead in one category, but is really good in all categories. at the time, i could have plucked one up, fairly loaded for $46-$47k, too. it's design could be polarizing, too. but again, being the ""odd ball"" i am, likeing the tl's previous design, i liked the lexus' design, too.

i understand people being polarized by the styling. but, no one can deny their trouble free nature, longevity, sport sedan handling and frugality when it comes to operation and maintenance. they are a lot of car for that kind of money.

so, are their better car out there than the 3 series? from my perspective, yes....lots of them. my reasons may be different than yours, though. you start loading one up to knock on the $60k+ door, and that list grows dramatically."

0,0,"i wonder why you test drove the acura acura but not the acura tl. i am no expert in this field, but it seems to me the tl probably compares ""better"" to an audi audi, bmw 3, cadillac cts and infiniti g (etc, etc). after having owned 29 audis, i sent emails to dealers requesting quotes on an acura tl ""advance"" awd, an audi audi prestige with sport package, an infiniti (also with several packages including sport awd), and a volvo volvo t6 with several packages to make it comparable to the audi/acura prestige/advance packages. i was planning to make my decision based on the best deal i could get on any one of these.

although i did look at a acura, it seemed a step down from the others i mentioned at the beginning of this post -- not a bad car, but more in line with an audi audi or perhaps an infiniti infiniti or a more basic version of some other car lines aspirational car.

a point is that, to me, all of the car in this class were contenders and i drove all of them (excluding the mb, why i can't recall). three of the car stood out as high performers (four, actually, but i'll get to that in a moment): the acura tl sh-awd advance, the audi audi prestige with sport package and 8-spd tiptronic and the volvo volvo t6 with several packages to increase its lux content levels to that of the audi and the acura. the fourth car that didn't make it to the finals was the g37x s -- a car i wanted to want, since i am so impressed with my wife's 2011 infiniti/premium (to say nothing of the $1,000 loyalty bonus).

the g didn't make it because it seemed so much smaller than the rest. i later figured out why -- it is less than 70"" wide, and it just seems cramped from behind the wheel. the tl, for instance is 74"" wide and has a 63.8"" track compared to the g's 60.2"" track. 

i made my decision, after 29 audis in a row, based on price per month. i was ready to take (and i wanted) an audi audi first, the tl second and the volvo third. i test drove the heck out of the car (and i currently have a 2009 audi audi prestige sport) and determined that the audi remained my fave (but, just barely, as the other two were very close.) yet, both the acura and the volvo were so much more powerful and actually seemed larger than the audi, which was a plus since i often have my in-laws in the back seat.

when all was said and done, the audi came in nearly $200 per month higher for 6 months longer than the acura and the volvo was about the same as the audi but for 36 months to the audi's 42.

i took the lowest cost alternative -- and since it came in with the advance package it is, msrp wise, about the same as the audi, but has a 305hp engine, although it lacks the audis 8 speed transmission.

having tested and previously having owned an audi s4, i came away thinking the acura tl sh-awd (what a mouthful) was ""somewhat closer"" to an s4 than it is to an audi, and for $11,500 less with similar content.

sorry for the long story, but i think you should have at least tested the tl, it is a completely different car than the acura, and seems like it would be less likely to be cross shopped with an audi or infiniti, etc. the tl, on the other hand at $47,000 with ""the works"" is about the same price and class as the audi and infiniti (and the cts for that matter.) 

in any case, in the entry level sport luxury class or whatever this is, most of these car are winners. :surprise:"

i've had 3 bmw. and, all of them have been as stout as anything i've ever owned. so, we'll have to disagree about how they age.

i've mentioned before, i've tried to like infinitis. i've test driven (several times) the new m37 and the infiniti. while the have the ""window dressing"" down pretty well. the refinement and suspension work is where they fall down....at least compared to what i drive.

we drove the slightly hp (+9) up-rated 2014 2.0t with the 8-spd tiptronic; then the 3.0t also with the 8-spd (of course, since that is all that is offered) then the 2.0t and so on.

i decided i really liked the ""detuned"" s4 engine enough to rule out even an all sported up audi 2.0t s-line -- meaning a new is 350 f sport awd was the only way to go. at the time, i knew i was not worthy of an s4 -- and besides, they were in a whole 'nother price class. 

so, i configured the is, got a ""no strings attached"" order placed (apparently none exist with the uprated sound system -- they have to be ordered?!) :confuse: and was prepped to wait 120 days. mean time back in audi-ville, the new 3.0t audi production reports started coming in -- we even got the arrival date and got the audi dealer to take the 2011 infiniti infiniti off of my wife's hands about 5 months ahead of the lease termination.

the audi dealer is a sweet-heart (due to our lengthy history with audi and the dealership) and a couple of weeks ago, the sales rep sent me an email offering test drives of an audi 2.0t (with sport suspension) and an s-tronic s4 (which i had already tested and was smitten by).

to make a long story short, my membership in the audi club got me an immediate 6% off of the sticker of a new audi and *bonus* got my wife a $1,000 loyalty bonus on her inbound 3.0t audi. 

it was like watching the exorcist 128 times in a row -- ""it got better and better every time.""

so, i said, get me a new s4 in ibis white (a no charge paint color) and nav and b&o and blind spot monitoring and i'm there.

no wait.

get me one, like the above but with the magma red leather interior and carbon fiber inlays.

there's one in the us (in ny) and none on a boat. never mind, i'll order one.

days later -- email dings: the ny car is yours.

it is being trucked from ny to cincinnati practically as we speak.

hmm an s4 vs an is 350 f sport? the s-tronic transmission (dsg) is worth the price of admission and the supercharged engine is, well, incredible and, all things considered, economical. put the thing in dynamic mode and it is a four-door hot rod. keep it in toyota mode and it is just south of a full-on lps.

i've never had a red interior -- but the pictures of the leather and the contrast with the white exterior seem, er, almost tasteful.

i'm starting to feel more worthy. :surprise:

that's a devastating statement from somebody who had been a fan and have spent high tens of thousands this often. my thinking is bmw doesn't feel the pinch now, because for one guy they lost, they gained couple of other customers who bought the nameplate and image, had no concept whatsoever what actual car sportiness really meant. the question is whether that sales surge is something permanent to enjoy, or temporary. one big value of enthusiasts is they provide free and most effective marketing. many of those buying their car today do so based on reputation built in the past, by guys like your buddy. it's hard to estimate how much that is worth, as some other people may also be turned off as well by the same enthusiast, perceiving them as juvenile snobs. it's clear that bmw has definitely lost the ""ultimate"" side for the sake of appeal to wider audience. we should see the long-term results of the move in ten-twenty years. as i recall, several other brands tried to pull that off and few succeeded.

btw, i recall a car magazine review (don't remember which one) shortly after bmw and ats came out. it was the 328 vs 2.0t. reading it was almost alice in wonderland experience - they gave ats higher score in most ""enthusiast"" related categories, from steering, to road feel, to some standard performance tests. yet, 328 was still a ""overall winner"" and they really didn't explain why. my thought was they simply ""grandfathered"" it into top position and knocked out ats on some creature toyota items (like that touch screen interface, they said was a four-letter word). in other words, ats was an ultimate driving machine of the two, but 328 was better to own at the time - which i find plausible, but it was an ""enthusiast"" test."
0,0,"is it me or the steering wheel looks big? the interior, especially the dash looks awesome though. overall the car looks pretty good, if the caddy designers toned down the massive grille just a little it can look much better. still have to sit in the cabin and actually touch the interior before giving it my final judgment."
0,0,"so, you say you got $47k msrp for $39k with taxes (that's what otd means in my dictionary)? even with dealer incentives, it's still five grand below dealer cost. wow, on that i can only say your it sounds just too good to be true, but since you say you got it, congratulations and kudos. 

now, on the resale: i'm no expert, i just sold a three year old car last week. first, the fact that dealers post $30k on something, doesn't mean you can sell same thing for that. buyers don't care about auction prices, but dealers do when they take a trade. if you want to sell it individually, be prepared for weeks of no phone calls interrupted by text messages from people wanting to give you less that dealer would. i just went through that personally just in last month. finally i sold it, but the reality was quite painful. you may have more patience and you obviously have more luck than me, so who knows. 

well, it is funny you said about the ""experiment"" car. that's very close to what i got (no m package, but regular sports package, convenience pkg and nav). the car was about $46.5k msrp. nowhere near your discount, but it was ordered, so no reason to go below costs either."

in regards to the 7 spd manual in the 911, i'm sure bmw will be moving to this soon to get their manual car into line with the epa too.

i agree with the thought process on this... it's the same reason i don't use a debit card. but, in reality, all car get an inspection at your home/business, and a printout is given to you then (3-4 weeks before turn-in). you owe what you owe, regardless of deposit.

0,0,"markcincinnati said:because they can . . .

maybe this is old fashioned thinking.

it seems to me, if you're going to market your car with a choice of ten standard (non-custom) colors, the price should include the cost of the paint. when the customer requests a ""non-standard"" or custom color, well, whatever the traffic will allow should govern the price.

i've taken the tour through the audi factory in germany (6 times), and they are very proud of the part of the tour where you get to see the paint booth. there is a display near the paint facility that has the entire spectrum of available colors displayed as somewhat large paint chips (for the workers or the customers? to see). there were dozens of audi colors apparently able to be specified -- i would call them non-custom.


roll up your arm and bend over!
bmw has what they call individual colors for both exterior and interior leather colors, as well as options, when you choose an individual color the car gets painted at a different facility, so the added price is the while process. now, the 3 gt is not built at the same factory as the 3 sedan, touring, 4 coupe and grand coupe. so for our gt to get painted mediterranean blue, the body would and parts would have to be taken off the assembly line, shipped to where the 3 series is built, painted and send back to the original factory for completion. bmwna does not allow for individual options on the 3 series in the us, but they are available for bmwag customers.

we took the bmw factory tour this time and watch 3 series sedan and wagons being built, was very interesting to watch."
0,0,"the acura acura is actually a re-badged honda. in japan, it sells as the ""honda"". so it's not viable for this category at all - not even close. no matter what lipstick and dress they put on the thing, it's still not a luxury car.

how does this tie into the tl?

the tl is sold as an extra-large honda over there. essentially exactly what toyota did with the toyota and toyota. same basic idea, just larger. honda is pimping it out as a luxury car, but it's really a large family sedan. essentially a japanese buick lucerne.

it's simply not part of this category, at least not in japan it wouldn't be. perhaps because we have such a miserable selection of good car in the u.s. compared to most of the rest of the world we might consider it to be a performance sedan, but it's really not.

this page gives a pretty good overview. 
i just returned from the mandatory one week instructor led training; there's a strong emphasis on product knowledge as well as how to relate to the clients that we work with. i don't fit the typical genius profile due to the fact that i'm retired from my ""real"" job and thus i'm considerably older; in my class of twenty the next oldest person was about ten years younger than me and the rest were in their early to mid twenties. in addition; i have no interest in a promotion to client advisor or service advisor- although i did ""sell"" a cpo i3 yesterday in that i conducted the presentation and evaluation drive so that the client advisor was able to close the deal in just a few minutes."

i see that someone on that forum calculated the investment return when he added 7 x $700 msd, and it worked out to 19.3% return on his $4900 (total return for duration of his 24 month lease). that's at least as good as most people can earn in private conservative investment.

i read that as well. putting $4900 down as a security deposit reduced the monthly payment by $40 a month. over 24 months, the return was over 19%.
but i'm guessing those that can afford to tie up $5k for 2 years aren't stretching to buy a 328 for $300 a month."
0,0,"i initially thought bmw will bring 320d. it is actually bringing 328d, which i suspect will have higher/similar torque to bmw, nominally lower power (as all diesels do due to lower revs). they announce 45 mpg highway. say it's true. let's also assume it will be priced between bmw and bmw, so starting msrp in low-mid 40s ($43k-$45k) sprinting to $50k with just leather and couple of conveniences. price difference about 3-5 grand with 328 and about 10+ with 320i (which is also stripped vs. bmw, not just engine). taking them at face value we get 45 mpg highway vs 33 mpg (at), good difference. i would caution excuberrance, as i have seen in the past other manufacturers promising outlandish values on their diesels in preanouncements to end up as much as 10 mpg lower after epa tests (that was the case with new volkswagen diesel). so let's assume 15 thousand miles per year, five years of ownership, 75k miles. lets assume msrp of $45k (bmw) vs $48k (328d), i.e. we have some options, all miles are highway (for simplicity) - we get:
1. bmw: 2272 gallons of premium at say $3.75/gal (number vary) = $8522 for five years.
2. 328d: 1705 gallons of diesel at say $3.90/gal (number vary) = $6647 for five years

amount saved: $1874. anticipated new car price difference: $3-$5k. the only other variable is depreciation. say we get 5% better depreciation of 328d, say 55% vs. 60% of depreciation $26.4k vs. $27k. 

in conclusion, not including higher taxes and financing (loan, lease), assuming msrp as benchmark, 328d comes up overall $2500-$3000 less expensive over 5 years. to me it's nothing, especially because:
1. bmw will likely enjoy better discount at purchase than 328d
2. if leased, bmw will likely enjoy better money factor than 328d; lower residual may offset that.
3. people who keep their car less than 5 years will see even smaller fuel savings.
4. diesel prices are even more volataile than gasoline. it is easy to imagine increase of the difference in price per gallon by another 10 or 15 cents.

there are a lot of other factors that could make the calculus more attractive for the diesel, but there are many other factors that could offset that, too. this was intented to be a demonstration how i would make a calculation if i had all the data, including mixed mileage, trying to take emotion out and account for all variables, not just one that is visible (mpg). i completely understand the gas mileage ford. it is easy to let go and forget about the costs that are already ""set"", like car payments. they are planned and accounted in home budget, out of sight, out of mind. but the gas bill comes every week or so, varies, even though it is planned, it springs up all the time and every unplanned trip adds to the bill. so it is easy to think that if i save on gas, i will spend less money overall. but that may or may not be true. without a cold meticulous calculation there is no way to tell. yet people rush to ""do something"" in every time gas price jumps 30 cents."

""hate my bmw, need help on 9th gen honda purchase.
...own a 2007 bmw coupe currently with 103k miles. ive owned the car for id say 6 months and am already more than $5000 in repairs so long story short, car gotta go its not for me...""
be curious about where s/he bought the car? dealer? private party? jeff's bait, tackle and bmw store?

$5k is a lot of work for someone not to be able to notice it on a test drive. you can hide some sins in a car. but, $5k worth should be relatively noticeable.

if financed, might be a tough trade. bought straight out? take your lumps and move on.
had the car for 6 months -- has 103k miles on it (how many did it have 6 months ago)? what was paid for the car 6-months ago (was it picked up below retail market? if so, how much below retail market)? let's just say it was picked up from a private individual ""as is"" and was offered up at $2k below retail market -- that would suggest a still healthy but less so investment of ""only"" $3k in repairs vs what could have been, should have been, etc.

are we counting such things as ""tires, brake pads, struts, rotors, cabin-filters, wheel-alignment and wiper blades"" as repairs? the last time i had to pay for a cabin filter it was a multi-hundred dollar affair, all in.

is this car this person's first bmw or first high-mileage european car? my neighbor with 80,000 miles on a pontiac (don't know the age), said the car was a money vacuum, in that it sucked all his money out of his checkbook. most folks, these days are wary of buying high-mileage car that are breathtakingly expensive to repair and maintain. 

and: how many times have we here said european car are breathtakingly expensive to own out of warranty? answer, about 139,659 times on this forum alone. of course, you can be forgiven if you didn't read this board backwards to 2002. really, we'll let that pass.

key question, was a full, complete, total, non-free inspection performed on the car prior to purchase; if so what did the inspection reveal -- you would think such an inspection would've picked up something that would have caused it to burn through $5k worth of ""repairs"" (see maintenance comment above), perhaps? 

whenever anyone i know asks me for my advice or opinion regarding a used-car purchase, i typically urge them to spend the money for a non-biased, not-free inspection from a specialist enterprise. here in rivercity, there are several bmw or german or european repair houses (not dealer affiliated) who for a 3-figure number will put together a report on the used car you are lusting for, outlining the expected near term costs of ownership.

i always seem to get someone here upset at me when i suggest it is often far cheaper (on a 12, 24, 36 or even 48 month basis) to lease a brand new, with warranty (and often maintenance-included) car than it is to buy a used one with the potential of requiring huge sums of money just to keep it running.

what would a 2007 bmw go for? locally a new bmw can be leased often for a number beginning with a 3. often honda can be had for even less, try $219/mo for a strippie for 27 months.

and (if it is a bmw) that mo/pmt includes the maintenance and free (well, you know) repairs for 50,000 miles. it seems to me to be hard to compete with these sub-vented leases, unless for some reason you think you are making an ""investment"" in a declining-value asset -- and even with bmw's that's a hard argument to win.

going to an honda, per se, is not a bad thing or a dumb thing to do -- in fact, such a move may very well be a good and smart thing to do; but unless the honda in question is 100% new with factory warranty and any mntce program that may accompany it, the same rule of thumb would apply -- get the damn thing rigorously inspected before buying/leasing/financing/acquiring.

some of us are ""types."" after dozes of german car, my wife and i each went with infiniti [her] and acura [me]; we liked the car for the most part, but it was really quite difficult to build up much passion or, actually, any emotion. my cousin, ""mr. honda or mr. mazda and now mr. kia,"" tried out a german and, although it was no trouble, he just seemed to resent (?) the fact that he had to interact with the car -- he just couldn't get into the ""don't forget to breathe"" tag line sign hanging low and large at the local bmw dealership.

maybe it is telling -- i am not certain ""what"" it is telling, however -- that the bmw's ouster will be followed not by another german or european or even premium car, but by a honda honda. again, there is nothing wrong with honda's, but i would typically think folks who like bmw's unlikely to shop honda's. were i in the same situation, i would likely be looking to get right back on the horse and, if possible, get a younger -- or new -- bmw."

0,0,"not sure what happend there with the pictures, but it looks like they were cut off. probably a story more suited to the sales front lines forum, but that one's drifted a bit.

so, how'd this come about?

well, gf had been driving my ford. she has a couple of vehicles of her own....an avalanche and a subaru....both in good shape. 

when i had test driven the s4, i admit i loved the way it drove. it's as fast as my bmw (maybe a tenth or two quicker with the s4, 0-60, if that's important to know). but, as good as the ride/handling balance is on my bmw, it's better with the s4. plus, i'd never sat in sport seat as good, or as comfortable as the ones in the s4. s-tronic dual clutch transmission is a gem.

trunk is bigger, more room, etc in the s4 (vs my bmw coupe). 

so, gf had been talking about how she was planning to sell the subaru as she wasn't using it much (because she was using my 2nd car, the ford, most of the time). in addition, my son, who's been driving a car i game him, an '06 honda honda, with about 100k miles, was talking about buying something else.

so, as we started plotting what, if anything we were going to do, i found a reason to test drive s4s at local dealers. we have two. one, about 30 minutes from me, the other about 45 mins-1 hour away. the closest one had one s4. nice car....they acted like it was made of solid platinum. the other one further away, had one '12 and one '13. they were willing to deal, but really low balled the trade.

speaking of the trade, i decided to take my son's honda back (actually, the title was still in my name), in trade for the ford (less than a year old with about 5k miles on it). and, he gave me $5k, on a loan i made to him a year or so ago.

with father's day upon us, we decided to spend the weekend, all together (gf, son, son's gf) in chicago (about a 4.5-5 hour drive). based on that, and the desire for the gf, and son's gf to go clothes shopping, and the men going car shopping. we drove the honda, with the understanding as described above. 

called a couple of dealerships around the chicago area to see if they had any s4s. not a lot of these car out there. one dealership had 4 of them, but all the rest had 1-2. again, these are scarce car.

did a little homework before heading out to the big honda. the honda was worth between low $9s to high $9s on a trade. i came down right in the middle since the miles were a shade high.....$9,500 was the trade number. i had also done some contract work for volkswagen of usa a few years back. my contact had told me at the time to let him know if i was ever in the market for a volkswagen product, and he'd get my a supplier number for the discount they offer (6% off msrp). i had that in my pocket.

0,0,"personal preference speaking here:
i do i do i do really like the audi family (espcially the s6) -- the current audi is, imnsho, a looker from the outside and mostly on the inside.
a few years ago, pre-widespread implementation of nav systems in the lps and ellps classes, pioneer electronics offered a replacement head-unit for many car, audi being among them.
the thing looked pretty standard, seemed to fit in nicely with the rest of the car (this was back in the days when audi car came with blaupunkt head-unit systems), at least as nicely as the audi oem units.
the pioneer solution included sat nav. the way it worked was to seemingly eject a rectangular panel horizontally and then articulate the panel (the screen), by 90 degrees.
at the time, i thought, ""gawd that looks soo after-market"" -- they (meaning audi) need to inegrate the navi screen into the dash, not copy this fugly looking contraption. once audi abandoned the very small navi screen between the tach and speedo and went with a 7"" widescreen aspect ratio built into the dash, i thought we'd taken a big step forward in interior design.
btw, why buy one of these $50k car without navi, etc and smack a tom tom or garmin unit onto a patch of velcro every-time you get in the car? or even more inexplicable, why buy one of these high-buck car without nav and then spend a king or queen's ransom to retro-fit the oem nav system (literally for double the cost of getting it on the car in the first place)?
virtually all the car-buff magazines agreed -- for years and years -- ""no one does interiors better than audi.""
i got my 2005 audi with all options, meaning the built in screen was present and accounted for, acting as my navi screen, as well as radio screen, telephone screen, etc etc etc.
as an aside -- i've had bluetooth for 10+ years and i saw a honda commercial last night on tv where you'da thunk the new 2015 honda honda ""now with bluetooth"" was making some cutting edge revelation. what's that about? i mean, seriously, i've had bluetooth for over 10-years and it is being touted as some great new feature that should make you want to consider a new honda ""as if"" the thing is a leader in automotive electronics.
my 2009 audi had an upgraded and improved version of the 2005 audi dash and, of course, added a back-up camera (which didn't come to the audi until the 2006 model year). don't get me started again on honda's cutting-edge inclusion of a back up camera on a 2015 car ""as if"" it was the second coming!
then, i start looking at the new audi's that came into the showroom in 2012 and they had that damn pioneer aftermarket screen protruding out and up every time you started the car. the salesperson says ""ok, if you don't like it, you can push a button to keep it hidden."" sure you can, but you'll miss radio info, telephone info and also other key information that is displayed and is to be acted upon from time to time -- so, you can't really keep that stick-em-up screen hidden since it is one of your key components for management of some of the car systems.
that damn pop-up aftermarket looking thing was/is one of my pet peeves about the then (2012) current cts -- but at least cadillac had some of the data visible when the screen was in its retracted position.
it looks even worse on the audi, since the dash is soo plain (barren from the middle to the passenger side, really.)
the macan, today, has taken over for the best new dash, if you axe me. audi needs to get rid of that protuberance in the audi and audi right away, like now. the audi and audi (for 2015) dash may be a bit dated, but it is crisp and clean compared to what seems to pass these days as modernistic. audi, look at the macan's dash from the perspective of a front seat occupant -- that should be your dash-look.
""you cursed brat! look what you've done! i'm melting! melting! oh, what a world! what a world ...""

stickguy....you're right. it's a not a direct line to get to where we ended up.

so, we left on friday after work....gf, son and me, on our way to chicago. grabbed dinner once we arrived (weber grill.....highly recommended). early saturday, gf heads for the miracle mile. my son and i head to the audi dealership.

we get there as soon as they open, 9:00 a.m. two s4s are sitting in front, one black, and one white, all cleaned up. the gf didn't care which one, but liked the black one, and the white one, based on pics the sales person sent her.

salesperson knew from our oh tags who we were, and immediately approached, offered coffee and doughnuts. ""yes"" to the coffee. ""no"" to the doughnuts (son helped himself though). i immediately liked the black over the white one. salesman gets the key, gives it to us for a test drive, as well as us giving the honda keys to him for inspection.

we take a 30 minute test drive. pull back to the dealership. salesman asks us to meet the general manager. we shake hands. he's a nice guy. explains that he hates giving trade quotes without seeing the trade. he points out a couple of small parking dings and paint chips on the honda.

knowing where this is going, i ask....""so, you think the $9,500 offer you made is one you can't support?"". a little hesitation, but in essence, that's what he was saying.

he wanted to counter. i really didn't care and got up. asked him if he was going to keep his agreement to at least cover our gas and lodging. he seemed surprised at the suddeness that this deal came to such an abrupt halt.

he said....""i don't want this to be adversarial. didn't you come to buy a car?""

""i did........drove 5 hours to buy one, as a matter of fact. not willing to waste any more time"".

the gm asked the sales person to get us some sodas. 

""can i see your supplier certificate?"" 

""sure, but i'm stuck on the $9,500 for the trade"".

he gave a cursory glance at the supplier certificate.

""we want you as a customer, no matter how far away you live. we're not going to dicker with you over a few hundred dollars. we appreciate you coming all this way to do business with us. congratulations on your new car.""

30 minutes later, finished with f&i, i was in the delivery area with the sales person going over the features. as we finished, the gm came out, gave me a $100 gift certificate to rosebuds restaurant in downtown chicago.

good deal. good dealership. good experience. great car!"
0,0,"so we left beaune wed morning about 9am, destination, charles de gaulle (gdc) airport, most of bmw drop off locations are at airports, we were scheduled to fly out of cdg, but the day before i found a much better flight out of london (rick has a couple of ex-co workers now living in london) cancelled the original flights now book our new flights out of london heathrow, all flights were booked on frequent flyer miles, and one nice thing is when you cancel there is no charge, most airlines these days will charge you a ""close in"" fee if you book an award travel with in 2 weeks, however, since i have elite status with aa, that is waved for me. 

we super slabbed it to cdg, nice thing about france is speed limit is 130kph, which is about 80, but like any country people travel faster then that. i averaged 90mph. we arrived at cdg at 130pm, got he car washed, (us customs requires the car to be ""clean."" there is a carwash at cdg, 8 euro later car was clean. now, if you have been to paris you know he honda is horrible to drive in, and the french are just crazy drivers (really look at their car), however, the route i programmed took us to the outside of paris and missed most of the traffic. about 30 minutes before getting to the airport, the windshield cracks, i did not hear a rock or something hit it. luckily the insurance on the car (that bmw pays for) will replace it. we get to the drop off location of the car, sign the necessary paperwork, and we are done, we say good by to the car, wont see her for at least 2 weeks. total 3127 k driven on this vacation. 




yes, there is a crack if you look in the middle of the photo




farewell photo...



the euro plates will stay on the car when it arrives at the dealer, and the dealer been instructed to leave the front plate on (az does not require a front plate.)

this trip was about bucket list items, so another one was to take the eurostar to london, the company that we dropped the car off took us to gare du nord train startion which is in the heart of paris, it was an interesting drive.. we made it in 40 minutes, lets just say the french just do not care who they piss off. we bought the tickets at the train station, and was on board minutes later, we got the last two seat together facing forward. when we got on the train, there was this french women sitting in one of our seat, the business class trains are set up with single seat on one side, and two seat on the other, the two seat are set up to seat facing each other, so two people facing the direction of travel and the other are not. we we arrived, in her very broken english she wanted us to take the other seat, we said no. we knew from the seat map when we bought the tickets 3 people were sitting here, not 4. come to find out, she decided she didn't like her single seat, plus a friend of her was on the train and wanted our seat. so they can sit together. now the other passenger arrives (older lady), then the cabin attendant. the single rider (older lady) sits where the young women was to have sat, but she was refusing to move, and wanted us to sit in the other seat. rick doesn't like traveling backwards. we tell the cabin attended this and we wanted our original seat, the young women speak french (but i think she speaks english too) to the cabin attended, so we end up in this circle of language, i think look at the young women, and said, i knew you speak english, so stop playing games. i was right, she did, so she understood everything i was saying, which really pissed me off. so i told her that we wanted our seat we reserved, if she didn't like then go find another compartment to ride in. she refused to move, needless to day, she won to a point, we were just moved to the business select premium cabin... like i said before of the french, we can do this because we are french.. it's the attitude that really piss's me off.. europstar trains and dirty, they are getting new trains, i hope they have wifi... 

we arrived in london about 7pm, ricks friends picked us up and took us out to dinner, then to our hotel.

conclusion

the whole trip we talked about how this car will invoke memories as long as we have it. this is really the only way to buy a car, bmw will allow you to keep your trade in until your car arrives, i'm sure audi and mb will do the same thing. the only difference on our next one, in the fall of 2017, we wont visit to many cities...

however, not sure where you are getting 6 years old. my (late production) 2005 911s is 26 months old. the local bmw dealer wants me to come in for a ""great deal"" on a brand new 2007 550i 6-speed (not a demo 23 miles on odometer). so, worst case scenario, that bmw is just barely 5 years old, possible as little as 4 and a couple of months, but definitely not 6.

and also, don't forget that bmw's sold for at least 100%+ of msrp, with no ability to get european delivery discounts. so, you can't really compare resale prices of a limited production car like the bmw to a mass produced 550i. the 2007 that the dealer called me on has an msrp of $69,880. i told him not to waste my time unless he's weilling to take at least $9,000 off and his response was that i could have the car for $61k tomorrow, if i wanted it. at this particiular dealership, if i had asked for a $500 discount on a 2003 bmw, i would have been laughed out of the showroom."
0,0,"i do like the s4's looks, styling, and engineering. not too many buttons, i did get button overload in the tl sh-awd and the center display behind the steering wheel was way too small for my tastes. the acura just goes nuts with buttons, and comes off as a ""techie"" car to me, whereas the audi comes off as an engineer's driver's driver car.

however, $55k is out of my budget. i'm already stretching and blowing the budget if i start at a stripper base model no options s4, which will get close to $55k out the door anyway given ca taxes and dmv fees. 

realistically i'm looking at a 2 year old s4 at about $40k vs. the tl-sh-awd brand new. 

what year is your s4? 

the other problem with getting a stripped no options s4 is i would really really like the bang & olufsen sound system upgrade, dsg (no brainer to me), and the rear sport differential. those are pretty much must haves (ok, the sounds sytem isn't a must, but highly worth the additional cost and you can get it as a stand alone add-on). also, i wish i could get the nappa leather as a stand alone low cost upgrade (as i've pointed out it takes the s4's seat/armrest, door lining interior up to another level and you can also get red, brown, or white mixed into your black bolsters), unfortunately, i think it comes packaged only with the premium plus or prestige packages $$$$. 

this is why a 2011 or 2012 s4 could be in my future rather than the one i looked at, which was a fresh off the boat brand spankin' new 2014 model in a beautiful metallic pearl dark grey. maybe because it was spotless and the tl's typically had been sitting for awhile with 100-200 miles on them it made the paint pop better on the audi.

that 2014 s4 had all the upgrades, 19"" wheels, nappa, b&o sound, adaptive suspension, bells and whistles $55k sticker. talk about lust. 19"" wheels are highly unnecessary and expensive though each time you buy tires, but they looked great (tri-spoke design). 

it's a shame your s4's been a dud reliability wise, i'd be angry if that happened to me. hopefully, you were just unlucky and most s4's are reliable. 

if i was going to consider bmw (which has a large share of reliability issues lately it seems), it would be the bmw, saw one at carmax for about $25k with about 37k miles 2009 sport package. no need for awd on a bmw in so cal.

of course the patient reader is told about the achievement of the ""neat trick"" of being more maneuverable, more powerful and more economical. the damn thing is safer, too -- it says so right in the ad copy.

the car is full of such amenities as pandora radio, bluetooth this and that, a rearview and sideview cameras , sat-nav, a voice activated bidet, collision warning, lane departure warning, lanewatch, a george foreman fryer with greaseblock technology, and even an available 6-speed manual shifter, and to motivate the thing, you can get a 278 horsepower v6 that actually reverses the greenhouse effect of smog (on a planetary basis) and (apparently) push-button start and hands-free ingress if you are so inclined.

don't forget adaptive cruise control -- honda didn't overlook this tech either. 

i'm sure i've missed stuff, i mean, c'mon the ad is four pages in length and mostly uses a small font as if this is an article about the thing, not an ad.

ok, so i read this and i see the picture of the interior which approaches handsome, not audi handsome but a far cry from any honda i've ever been turned-off by (including my '12 acura tl, which, while quite functional is hardly grin inducing when you get behind the wheel.)

now, then, as to the title of my post -- i'm used to the audi audi getting the bells and whistles long before the audi and usually before the audi and way way way before audi's ""cousins"" the volkswagen clan. i'm at least aware that cadillacs [used to] get features, functions and other high-end content (aka, ""stuff you'd like to have in your chevrolet or pontiac or buick, even) before the lesser aspirational models. i assume that the new ats, cts and cadillac all have content that is, for the time being, exclusive to caddy's -- wouldn't want a lowly buick buick to have blind spot monitoring or adaptive cruise control or whatever gimcrack or gewgaw du jour marks a premium car's territory (these days).

the top o' the line from any car maker or ""family"" of car usually gets the new tech, new toys, new safety kit or partridge in a pear tree before those poor cousins downstream, er, down-market.

so, this 2013 honda gets content, tech, etc, etc, that certainly seems like prime beef from as recent as 2011 in many of the world's high buck, high zoot, high prestige makes. hell, this honda seems awfully close to being premium-car state-of-the-art insofar as content and even safety engineering (high strength steel, and ""ace ii"" a body structure engineered to evenly distribute full-frontal crash energy [or nudity] more effectively for instance). now the engine choices are hardly revolutionary, but they do (claim) to now include direct injection powerplants, cvt transmissions with paddle-shifters (yawn) and ""double-downshifting"" conventional 6-speed autos with rev-matching.

my point is, shouldn't all this content, kit, performance and safety rigging be introduced first in the acura line? then after two-years, one at-least, and only then be trickled down to the honda's?

i'd like to find a lease in the $300-350/mo range of something that gets better mileage than the mazda (20-21 in mixed use) and is fun to drive. the cla and 320i both fit the bill, i think. i looked at the lexus ct200h last weekend; it's pretty nice inside and 40mpg is outstanding, but not sure it would provide the 'fun' i'm looking for.

imo the g has some attributes(mpg not being one, it sucks and another reason i did not buy) that are better than the 3 which i think (most) everyone can agree on ie. power, interior sophistication, low(long term) maint. and repairs. in other ways it is about equal ie resale value, dealer experience. the area where it and just about every asian or american car falls short is in the suspension, steering gear and weight distribution which gives the bmw such a dynamic driving experience that hasn't been duplicated. but i also argue that the vast majority of people buying the 3 don't use, need or appreciate that driving dynamic as they lease their auto(like over 90% take rate) tranny ""beemers"" to impress. and that comment was not meant to insult the true enthusiasts that buy it for the drive and not the show. so if you take that factor away as a real draw then things equal out a bit more. the new ats is apparently very close and maybe better in some respects from the reviews that i've read but it is too new to really even form an opinion on yet. although i'm sure many bmw fanboys have pretty much written if off already."

i guarantee that it's not ""american"" in how it's designed or drives. probably the only thing that gm has for sale now, in fact, that is like that. 

my second recommendation is actually also from gm, but you'd have to get a 2009 model, because gm stopped importing it to the u.s. then. go test drive a pontiac pontiac/holden commodore. it's a fantastic vehicle and is no problem to find one for less than 20k, certified. if you want something that handles well, is rwd, has a nice interior, and is a total sleeper/under everyone's radar, while being one size larger than a infiniti - without the silly price tag, look no further.

i personally like it more than the current cts. i'm still incredibly shocked that gm took it's #1 selling passenger car in australia(and best imo, that they currently make worldwide) and stopped importing it to the u.s. such an incredibly idiotic move. but you can get one used. change the badges if you wish.  note - it's also sold outside the u.s. as the new chevrolet chevrolet. so at least there's some hope of it returning next year or so.

these two are the only options from gm that will satisfy you if you like how the tl and infiniti and so on drive. everything else, yes, it's a toad and should be avoided. but do check these out - you might be able to get a used/certified car and own it for only a little more than the payments on a lease of something like a 3 series."

in addition to the pollution, the volkswagen's not an entry-level luxury car.

i may not be, but it's nice. i just drove a rental tdi in scotland for a week and i didn't feel much deprived vs. my 430 gc. the vehicle was a relative base (cloth seat, no nav), but the overall level of equipment, fit and finish was quite good. despite being fwd, it was nicely responsive, but i have to admit, the ""spritited"" handling was last thing on my mind there, as i was more focused on not hitting anything and constantly fighting my cross-wired senses (left is right, right is left). nevertheless, it would have been quite good substitute if you didn't want to shell out as much money. of course i didn't like that diesel's characteristics as much as my gas engine, but it wasn't a tractor, as say my late dad's 2005 audi tdi.

i feel compelled to point out that you're wrong: nordschleife lap times

as you can see scrolling down, the audi tt rs coupe is 8:09 and the (old) cayman r was 8:06. but even more impressive is the new 2013 boxster s, which has come in at 7:58. with the weight reduction and chassis improvements, i expect the new cayman being somewhere between that time and the 7:37 posted by the new carrera s. my bet would be 7:48 for the cayman s.

but i don't need to go to germany with a racing helmet to form my personal opinion. even with moderately vigorous test drives, i have felt the weight and bulk of audi's. for a big luxury sedan like the audi, not a problem. for an audi, a little more so, for the s5, it didn't feel as nimble as a 335is or bmw. the tt s (i haven't driven the rs), was not as rewarding to drive as my old s2000, let alone a boxster s or cayman. it has a great looking interior and probably is the most comfortable with cruise control on at 75 mph on the highway, but that's not the top of my priority list for a sports car. btw, i am even more critical of the bmw z4. the make a great diesel suv, as my garage can attest. but not a very compelling so-called sports car.

i understand audi has elected to go with awd as their preferred performance drivetrain. it certainly beats fwd to death. but it adds weight and takes away the nimbleness of rwd when you get into the sport sedan, coupe and sports car categories, imo. i'd make the same claim relative to porsche. give me a gt3 over a 911 turbo any day. or if you are feeling really generous, a gt2.

p.s. price vs. weight. yes, i agree with a previous post that porsche has a few more engineering dollars to spend to squeeze out more weight. the point i am making is that right now, audi doesn't seem to think that weight is a problem, period. that's an attitude issue, not a cost one."
0,0,"perhaps awd is in porsche's blood what with audi, volkswagen and porsche all being related

that will get the blood boiling with a lot of porsche enthusiasts that are far more knowledgeable and much more proficient sports car drivers than me. i've been casually shopping for a replacement for my 911 c2s that i sold 18 months ago. in the process, i've attended a porsche track event and test driven several car, new and used. the conversations i've had with porsche employees, enthusiasts, and professional drivers has been pretty educational. 

bottom line, very few serious porsche enthusiasts consider the 911 turbo (awd) to be the pinnacle of the 911 line. they put the gt3 rs4.0 on top, gt3 next followed by gt2. some would put the new 991 c2s ahead of the 997 turbo. they like naturally aspirated engines and rwd. the gt2 is the rwd answer to the turbo s, and is fast as hell, but not preferred by them over the gt3. 

the awd 911 turbo and various ""4"" car were, as explained to me, partly based off the fact that the 911 rwd has a front/rear weight balance of roughly 37/63 and some buyers liked having another 150+/- lbs over the front wheels and some extra grip. that was usually followed by a thinly veiled ""amateur"" adjective to further describe that type of buyer. but not the preference of the serious enthusiasts, it seems. as a matter of fact, i have heard from several that they have acquired 993 turbos (last of the air cooled engines) and actually disconnected the front drive train to make them rwd. 

the cayman and boxster will never be awd. they are already perfectly balanced and light. 

my pig headed comment was probably unfair. audi has built quite a reputation on quatro. but remember, they started out as fwd, which is the worst of all worlds, so awd was really a necessity if they didn't want to fire all of their engineers and start over. a rwd tt rs is probably not in the works, and the fact that the heavier awd tt rs has none of the feel and sharpness of a cayman s or r is probably not important to the typical audi customer. but it would be to a porsche enthusiast."

they have the ""condition based"" service, which is capped at 1 year. they lowered the mileage cap to 12k, i think. condition based service is calculated by the computer based on driving severity. the only thing it doesn't take into account is environment. they don't have oil sensors (i don't think anybody does), so if it gets dusty or contaminated, you wouldn't know it."

point of all this, you guys are right. the only consistent price point you can depend on is the msrp. we don't pay that. but, it's the only consistent number you can reliably use, that has no bearing on geography, lease vs buy, demand (or not), etc.

,,"regarding the whole start/stop thing while sitting stopped at a light or some such, i don't think it will affect engine longevity at all. why? because the bulk of engine wear comes when cold starting an engine where the lubricant has had a considerable amount of time to drain down into the sump; a couple of minutes at a light just isn't all that long in the grand scheme of things.

other fuel economy related thoughts:

i find the concentration on things like transmission oil temperatures for improving fuel economy curious, and if i might be so bold, highly questionable. from my perspective, for a relatively modest investment (compared to the potential gain), it makes sense to me to harvest the latent heat radiating off the exhaust system to power the various subsystems of the vehicle. i'm thinking there is many-many times the necessary power lost in the form of radiated heat to drive the electricals, the power assist pumps, the a/c compressor, and even the valve train (electrically or hydraulically).

remove the mechanical load of all of those components from the engine and fuel economy should easily see a double-digit percentage gain. the only company which has announced such a research project is bmw; hopefully it will become a reality sooner than later."
,,"there are plenty of resources -- both subjective and objective -- that discuss the german car personalities or that decry the japanese for making appliances.

all the ""did too"" ""did not"" that we may throw out here can also be additional data points -- there are so many of us we're not just relying on anecdotes, that is.

virtually all car have improved in reliability and durability -- but for whatever reason the japanese car (regardless of where they really come from) certainly seem to win the durability sweepstakes while the german car typically win the fun to drive contest but pretty regularly are written about as being less durable.

my rattle free tl or my wife's rattle prone bmw certainly can't be assumed to represent all acuras or bmw and certainly shouldn't be assumed to represent anything other than themselves.

the surveys that are availble, however, regularly and frequently conclude that a japanese car family (fill in the blank) will often far outlive a ""similar"" german car family (also fill in the blank) insofar as durability is concerned. and of course there is the matter of the expense of keeping any car beyond a certain point.

one of the folks i work with has a 13 year old lexus and a 10 year old bmw -- both with well over 100k miles on the odometer. both car are paid for -- yet the bmw is often being driven in so that it could get the latest $1,100 repair or replacement part -- never has the lexus required such an outlay, according to my buddy.

on the other hand, another co-worker's bmw required new rotors and pads at 50,100 miles and his service cost almost the day out of warranty was over $1,800.

now i wouldn't say the bmw was non durable due to the service costs the day the warranty died -- it just seems odd that would happen so young. the japanese car, have earned a reputation for long long lives -- we, here, are not the cause of such reputations, but perhaps there is something to it.

the european car -- germans in particular -- do not enjoy such reputations, no matter what we argue here. :surprise:"
,,i would certainly say so.
,,"i'm definitely not a ""read tester""- the type who provide ""expert"" opinions on car they haven't even sat in, so i relate the following with the understanding that i haven't driven either car.
i was thumbing through the june 2013 copy of the british magazine car and it contained a very positive review of the new s3. that review was followed by a comparison of the s3 to the mk7 volkswagen with the performance pack(an extra 10 hp, better brakes, and an electronically controlled mechanical limited slip diff). the same guy(ben pulman) wrote both articles and he concluded that aside from the s3 being @1.5 seconds quicker in the 0-62 mph sprint, the volkswagen was essentially the equal of the s3 in all but the worst road conditions. given the price differential, he would ""...take the volkswagen every time.""

,,"i assume you want a used car - and it has to be quite used (4+ years old). i own bmw myself, but bought it new with maintenance. i love, but would not get one for 18 grand, especially if did not have more money to spend after the purchase. 

if maintenance costs are real issue for you, start with acura acura or tl. tl is definitely more luxurious, but more expensive and larger; you'd get newer acura. acura is smaller, but also more chevrolet and better on gas. tl is basically luxury version on honda. acura is a top line of european/jdm car also called honda honda, but it's a different vehicle altogether.

my second choice for low maintenance entry level/semi luxury would be 2005-2010 subaru subaru gt or 3.6r (the last letters are important - it's a turbo version or 6-cylinder of subaru, respectively). gt is very fast and has 6-speed manual transmission (if that's important to you), not so great on gas and may be hard to find. subaru 3.6r limited has a smooth 6-cylinder engine and at and also decent level of equipment. 

third choice - infiniti g35. for 18 grand, it may already be too old to be ""problem free""."

for instance the audi audi has a starting msrp of c.$38k, but as far as i can tell no such models are ever built or sold. the least expensive audi at my local audi dealer has an msrp of c. $45k. 

and then we have the example of the kia stinger, which seems like a very impressive car, the equal to something from bmw or mercedes-benz benz if they offered something like that, but at an msrp of thousands less. and because of the huge lease incentives the msrp of the singer is deceptive on the other side. you might think that with an msrp of $45k or more that a loaded stinger is out of reach, but since it's actually c. $10k less it becomes quite good deal."

,,"flightnurse said:car manufactures will never make everybody happy. i would assume too many customers complained about the driveablity of the dsg in normal traffic enthusiasts will always lose out.
with all due respect and a showing of [my own] ignorance, i wonder what driveability issues are you referring to?

given that both hardware and software components are in a state of constant revision, i can share some observations from the perspective of one who has a 2014 sq5 (8-speed tip) and a 2014 s4 (7-speed dsg) in captivity.

the programming of the tip makes it the best iteration of the ""slush"" transmission -- as someone called it -- i've ever driven. the dsg is the smoothest transmission i've ever driven in that, when left in auto shift mode, the shifts are basically heard, not felt. i know the transmission has up-shifted by ear and by virtue of the drop of the tach needle, but the progression in feeling is unlike traditional torque converter auto transmissions and unlike manual transmissions. both the tip and the manual transmissions have a momentary disruption of forward momentum when the transmission decides to shift or when the driver depresses the clutch -- watching from the side, when either one of these transmissions is up-shifted, the heads of the driver and a front-seat passenger are momentarily ""thrown"" forward at the moment of the depression of the clutch or up-shift of the auto -- there is no such throwing or lurching with the dsg -- in fact in that one aspect, i would think the dsg could be said to be somewhat like a cvt. somewhat, not much, but a little ""somewhat.""

downshifting, again, is an area where the dsg hyundai. -- when in full auto-mode ""s""port shifting program, the dsg transmission rev matches to the imminent downshift and the ""second"" clutch engages with virtually no kick. only a manual transmission even comes close to this, but having said that, the dsg is so much smoother on a rev-matching down shift it isn't even close.

now, i've driven the s4 (dsg), sq5 (tip) and s6 (dsg) equipped car -- of the three, two of them are just that little bit better in terms of their shifting prowess and smoothness. again, with all of the above subtleties stated for the record, it is apparent that someone at audi (or whoever writes the software) has done everything they can to make virtually all of the ""dead giveaways"" that you are driving a tip as invisible and imperceptible as possible. in short, unless you're really looking for hard evidence that the sq5 isn't a dsg, you might not really notice the sq5 is not a dsg. over time and with the availability (as i have) of two very very similar car to drive back-to-back for comparison, well, you probably would be able to discern the subtle differences between the dsg and the tip. 

at this stage of my own posterior meter, i can tell the difference between the dsg and the tip -- the tip, not the dsg has some hint of drivability issues and even placing the tip in ""s"" all of the time doesn't completely wipe out the ever-so-slight shift hesitation and shift lurch behaviors, although you really have to be paying attention to notice them.

i have not (yet) driven an rs7 -- frankly because i just don't think it is worth $120,000 (even if i had millions in the check book to do with as i please). i also don't think an s7 is worth $10,000 more than an s6 just for the body style. but i'm also the guy who resents an extra charge for ""paint"" beyond gloss black or gloss white.

i bring the rs7 up, not to reveal my proclivities and, er, cheapness for things such as pearl paint colors, but to remind anyone who needs to know, that audi puts the very specially programmed 8-speed tip in the rs7. several reviews of the car noted their assumption that the rs7 transmission was another very fine implementation of the dsg; and, then, noting later in their review how virtually imperceptible the tip is from the dsg as executed in the rs7.

under full throttle in dynamic mode, both our s4 and sq5 are prodigious accelerative forces of nature -- both of them emit the joyful ""phltttbbb"" (aka fart sound) upon up-shift and when in s mode have quick paddle shift moves (but paddle-shifts are just a smidge quicker in the dsg, however).

again, were the audi folk to gift me (fat chance) a 2017 my s4 prestige 8-speed tip with a torque vectoring rear differential and with red leather seat, i would be a happy man. of course, this is based on my assumption that the hardware and especially the shifting software of the 2017 s4 tip had continued to move it even closer to the characteristics of a dsg (which appears to be the programmers goal).

i have heard that the bmw implementation of the dual-clutch auto did indeed have driveability issues -- but i have only heard that the audi and porsche implementation and programming of the dsg have few, if any, critics.

what are the audi dsg transmission issues?

and, why, if the dsg is not a fun, friendly transmission for daily driving, do they (the mfgrs) keep making the programming of the tip versions as close to the feeling of a dsg as possible?"

the steering did not get any better over time. i must admit, the car moved in prescribed directions, so it's not like there was no response. but there was no feedback - basically no feeling. am i at the limit, can i go faster? nothing.

the 2.0l turbo engine is fast and torquey, transmission is brisk and great. if there is any automatic i can have, that's the one. these are admittedly strongest points of the new f30, especially with gas mileage almost 20% higher than my car in same conditions - impressive. but... i take my e91 3.0l na with manual back and no thanks to a new car any time soon. hard to explain. i may change my mind over time, but not today.

interior dials are really cheaper in feel and over time felt cheaper and cheaper. to describe the difference is between feeling a soft bump (e91) and hard ratchet (f30). the plastic on those also feels cheaper. i also just noticed that the sunroof liner was not motorized, as opposed to my wagon, but to be fair, i don't remember is e90 sedan had sunroof liner motorized or not. the wagon has a long panoramic sunroof, so the liner has to be moved with its own motor, as it is too far for the driver to reach when he wants to close it from the back. the non-nav screen has 4:3 aspect ratio, the long panoramic ratio on my e91 nav is so much better. from pictures it looks their optional nav screen is still panoramic, so you get a different screen than standard version.

,,"when the oil life percentage in my ford gets to 0%, ford says to change the oil within 500 miles. that indicator has a level of safety built in. 

evidently, in the cts's case, 0 life was really very close to 0% and there was no leeway. gm changed it to be twice as sensitive (2011) so it tells you it's time in about 6 months or 6000 miles, which gives you a fair amount of leeway. note - anything less than about 25% protection is running into greatly increased wear with synthetic oils. if you are running an older (2011 or older, evidently) cts, letting it drop below 50% oil life remaining is causing increased wear and problem. 

i ran into this a few years ago when i was looking for a car for my parents. and back then the mechanics at the dealers were all saying to get it changed at 6 months/6k miles. (the manual says almost twice that interval) that they didn't do a recall is a whole other problem, but the mechanics certainly figured out what had happened with the oil life sensors several years ago. 

so the engine isn't the issue. in fact, it's the best engine gm has ever built. it, not too surprisingly, wasn't really designed to run on synthetic goo which some marketing genius managed to pass off as ""oil"". gm kind of found this out the hard way, it seems. 

note - there is nothing that says that you can't run semi-synthetic in the car, either. in fact, the newer oil that they put in it at the dealership when you get it changed (on 2011+ models at least) is actually semi-synthetic. gm doesn't want to admit that their engines shouldn't be run on pure synthetic and are ""suggesting"" their new dexos standard oils. 

yes, it's buried way way in the fine print, but dexos is semi-syntietic oil under a new brand name/standard to try to confuse the issue, since they spent over a decade ruthlessly pounding into everyone's head that pure synthetic oils were better than conventional ones.(which is not true, obviously)

so the fix? switch to semi-synthetic asap. change oil every 6k miles/6 months. ignore the computers and change the oil religiously at those intervals. semi-synthetic costs about twice as much per change, but you change it half as often."

,,"this thread is more than a tad interesting since i, for one and apparently more than one, seem to find some surprise that the acura and a 3 series bmw (even though it is the ""bad"" one) merit cross-shopping.

the tl sh-awd seems like the obvious choice to cross shop an awd bmw 3 series with, assuming one must cross shop an acura and a bmw.

but, of the choices offered up in this thread, i would find the audi 2.0t audi with the pre-paid maintenance (or perhaps the volvo volvo t6) to be even more of an apples-to-apples comparison worthy of cross-shopping. then i look at my recent purchase of a tl, after 29 audis in a row, and knowing what i cross shopped, well maybe i see the rationale of shopping for both a bmw 3 x-drive and a tl sh-awd (but never a acura.)

having had three awd bmw's since 1988 (in addition to the 29 audi's), there is no comparison between the bmw and the acura in terms of the ""feel-behind-the-wheel"" -- and, moreover, in winter, four driven wheels are much better than two, even if those two are the fronts.

although not comparable to the bmw in terms of the ""ultimate driving experience"" the tl sh-awd does a better imitation of an audi audi 2.0t audi prestige than any other japanese car i test drove. in fact the tl sh-awd advance (which adds 19"" wheels and tires) actually felt pretty competent compared with an 2011 audi s4 premium+.

given the two choices you offered up for us to weigh in on, the acura is only comparable to the bmw in that they both have four wheels -- the bmw is that much better.

there doesn't appear to be any suspension or driveline damage, but both bumpers were ripped off, and both front fenders were pushed back and up into the a-pillars. the oil cooler is bent out of shape. we didn't see any evidence of frame damage, but the glove box doesn't close properly anymore, leading me to suspect more unseen damage. there are numerous light paint scratches all over the passenger side of the car. i haven't driven it, but the engine runs, there are no new leaks, and the rear wheels are still attached to the crank, so that's something.

most of the expense from the bodyshop estimate is because they would replace body panels and have to paint the entire car to get a good blend. do a four-wheel alignment and then insurance added $2500 for additional unseen work that is expected to be needed. total estimate to repair is $15k - $17.5k.

,,"breld said:if i recall correctly from the articles on the audi, that actually will come with the dsg as the sole transmission. with the upgraded 2.0t and the apparently improved driving dynamics, that should be very competitive in the segment. 
breld:

one can only hope you are correct. the dsg, of course, that i would expect would be the latest and greatest 7-speed dsg such as is offered as the optional (to the manual) transmission on the current s4. the press releases i have seen and have translated, however, claim the s4 will have the 8-speed tip. current audi 2.0t models come with the 8-speed tip, but not the dsg 7-speed. now, then, however, therefore, notwithstanding:

the current iteration of the s3 only comes with a dsg transmission -- a 6-speed version. i assume there are factors that impact what is and what can be, but i have to assume the 7-speed dsg is heavier than the 6-speed dsg. what i don't know is if the 8-speed tip is lighter than the 7-speed dsg, however.

i see no logic (marketing logic, which is as opposed to 'real' logic) in audi offering us customers the audi with a 6-speed dsg since most of the audi's sold in the us the past few years have been 8-speed tips. i assume the number of takers on fwd audi's in the us is quite small, so for practical purposes, i will exclude them from my following remarks.

many of those in the market (for an audi audi) for the first time, are probably cross shoppers, shopping against bmw, mercedes-benz benz and perhaps even acura, infiniti and lexus. in a world where ""more is better,"" i can only assume a new audi audi will receive a ding if it doesn't offer at least as many speeds as the car it competes with. bmw 3's will soldier on with 8-speed zf sourced transmissions, acura will have, what, a nine speed transmission? mercedes-benz benz 7-speed, infiniti 7-speed, who knows if lexus will, for the 2017 my offer 6, 7, 8 or more speed automatics -- they've been having 6-speed units on the awd versions and 8-speeds on the rwd car, so, perhaps they have or will soon be upgrading to all 8-speeds or, who knows even more speeds?

the new shopper will have to consider number of gears as a data point and if, for some reason, audi chose to offer 6-speeds (dsg or not) while the other guys had 7, 8 or 9 speed units, i would think there would be some logic to the buyer saying, ""more is better, so audi is now not at the top of my list.""

i have not seen any evidence, and boo hoo (no sarcasm), it certainly appears that the dsg 7-speed will no longer be offered on the b9 audis.

the only good news is that the 8-speed tiptronic hardware and most especially software does continue to improve by imitating the dsg via a very expertly developed shift program. said it before, i'm at least ok with the 8-speed tip since it remains the best torque converter automatic i've yet driven.

,,"if i can get that kind of performance out of auto/manual transmissions, i won't need a manual.

i'm going to go out on a limb here and suggest that no one in this forum needs a manual or a dsg. if i have offended any formula one drivers, my apologies. 

i've driven the new 911s with pdk transmission. according to the experts (the real ones, not me) it's crisper, faster and better than any other dual clutch auto manual made, including ferraris latest and greatest. but it just doesn't give me that same sense of involvement and satisfaction. that's really what it's all about for me. and, i suspect, most others that prefer a three pedal manual transmission. 

analogy: when i volkswagen, i like to play the course from the tips (7,000+ yard back tees). i know it's likely to add 2-3+ strokes to my score over 18 holes, but i get more enjoyment playing the entire course than cut out 500+ yards so i can pat myself on the back for a slightly better score. 

there are some car - the tl especially - in which the manual is clearly better than a traditional slushbox automatic in performance, objectively and subjectively. but there are other car - the s4 and 911 to name two - in which the transmission choice merely represents a personal ""engagement"" preference. agree?"

,,"you may be right about your longevity concern -- i really don't know. what i have read, however, is that the full stop, engine shut off, then engine restart when ""the light changes"" will save countless gallons of fuel once this tech is widespread.

perhaps there is little to be concerned with about the engine -- i would, however, wonder if the constant restarting of the engine would not be hard on the starter motor?

in any case, i assume this auto shut off will be placed in widespread use as we strive to save every drop of fuel we can by almost any and every means even remotely possible.

somewhere i read that there is a patent on a technology that ""warms up"" the transmission when the car is started cold; this warm transmission apparently yields a bit more mpg's, and, over the life of the car, this ""bit more"" adds up. it is especially interesting when one extrapolates this to millions of car and finds that the annual savings ends up being a governmental sum of money and fuel saved (so they say.)

fuel saving tires have been in production and use for years (you can tell i watch too much tv) -- even though the savings per car are only a few drops of fuel annually (but again when extrapolated to millions of car, these drops become a big deal and big bucks.)

mostly (which is not the same as entirely) i am for virtually all new technolgies and also for the upgrading of ""older"" technologies to make them ""better"" (and greener, too, if possible). when a new technology is found to be wasteful, harmful or just plain inappropriate though, i am all for scrapping it, beginning a new project or exploring a new idea and moving forward. :surprise:"
,,"i think the thing to remember is that the north american market was a very small part of audi's empire at the time of the alleged 5000 problem, (whether that was electro-mechanical, human stupidity - or worse), and probably still is. a poor name in one - at the time small market - doesn't mean a company is destined for the scrap heap, as evidenced by their continued success worldwide.

here in europe i believe the 5000 was badged as a 200 and was highly regarded, i.e. the 100's big brother. i don't recall any similar incidents over here, at the time or since, with audi car. i don't drive an audi; never owned one as i believe they are over-priced volkswagen in pretty dresses. i much prefer my volkswagen dressed as skodas for many reasons, not just price but also better build quality and dealerships. however, audi have been building fine car for a long time and, if you must have the badge and are prepared to part with the money, then why not ?

interesting that audi are a relative newcomer to the high-end market, (or any market), unlike skoda who have been around for considerably longer and even survived the disaster that was east european communism. the original skoda superb was a competitor for rolls royce et al in it's day. try the googly thing to see about it. the current skoda superb puts audi to shame in the value department, (and quite a few others, also). but i doubt it's coming your way in the foreseeable future.............vag aren't stupid.

that is exactly what is developing. why buy a car that will cost more than fitting your children with braces just to fix the added gadgetry. more parts that will eventually fail.

i switched from owning to leasing as a result. no more warranty, no more car. the added cost up front is valuable to me in two ways: new car every three years and paying up front for only part of the depreciation. the only way i would buy is with the intent to sell at the 3-year mark.

i know this is the more costly strategy. how much more is debatable and depends upon the model lease to lease. the enticing thing is opportunity to experience new choices as the market changes. perhaps a hydrogen-3'er soon!

weird thing is, edmunds tmv is far, far less than kelley/nada, not only on dealer retail, but also on trade. this is first time i saw such discrepancy - usually it is that edmunds tells you trade is more than kelley/nada, but retail is less. here, they all three values down by several thousands. i think it has something to do with low supply due the tsunami. seeing my transaction, i'm inclined to thing edmunds is wrong this time - it looks to me as a computer calculating price based on predicted value rather than actual asking/transaction prices, which seem to be in kelley/nada case."

nothing wrong with a '93 prizm. i had a '92 back in '93. wanted a '93, but was duped by the salesman.

,,"cdnpinhead said:the alphabet-soup transmissions are probably wonderful, so long as they work and/or are under warranty.

when they break (and they do), then it's time to find out if the technicians at the dealership even know how to spell transmission. most of them are told to remove and replace the whole assembly. if it's under warranty, then it's ""only"" a couple of visits to the d'ship and some amount of time in a loaner. if it's not. . .

mark is a well-known proponent of never driving anything out of warranty. i've driven most of my vehicles way, way beyond the warranty coverage. we differ.

i like manuals. for simplicity and maintainability reasons, i seek out vehicles with them. my drive to and from work every day, and the trip up to the cabin and back, make use of (at most) 20% of the capability of the vehicle i drive. i just need the vehicle to need minimal attention. back when i drove among vancouver, edmonton, calgary & regina through the canadian rockies in the middle of the night, having a vehicle that demonstrated excellent handling was important. now it is not; the latest and greatest technology is for those who love bells and whistles. actual driving rarely enters the discussion the fraser canyon at 2 am was a wonderful thing.

many pretend, as they go around on-ramps. i'm not interested, but recognize that many are. ymmv .
like you, i tend to own the car that i drive exclusively for a very long time(club sport: 20 years wrangler: 13 years, ms3: 8 years)- i'm apparently immune to the shiny object syndrome. that said, at the request of my lovely bride i'm going to relent and check out a cpo 2013 e92 335is at my local dealer; it does have an almost perfect option list for my purposes- nothing but the cwp(i wish it was a sunroof delete car but those are rare as hen's teeth). and three pedals, of course. checking out the etk, if i were to trash the six speed-an incredibly unlikely occurrence- a bmw remanufactured replacement costs around $3600. the optional dct? almost $8,000- and while the dct appears to be relatively reliable, failures have occurred.

in any event, it's probably academic, as i really liked the sti i sampled and i have yet to try a new ford gt with the pp."

at 3500-3600 lbs and a wheelbase that's just under two inches shorter than a buick buick, the current 3 series is a bloated pig that's nothing like the older car from the 90s. which could still be called sport sedan.

,,"michaell said:try make an order at a honda dealer - you get rolling eyes, laugh, dismissal, or even anger. not to mention that honda itself simply doesn't build ordered car - it builds whatever it thinks will sell and then maybe you get lucky when one of those car will be what you ordered. there is some chance, as they generally limit possible combinations. 

look at the option list for a bmw, then for an honda. big difference. really, the only ""options"" are for dealer added accessories. you want leather for your chrysler? sure, here's the katzkin catalog. can't get it from the factory. at all.

but you can option up a 320i to $45k if you tick all the boxes.

it's not comparing apples to oranges. more like apples to coffee tables.
i was aware of that. current situation is a result of years of ""streamlining"". i probably should have chosen toyota as my example, as those guys have much more elaborate option structure, yet the ordering mindset is just like honda's, not bmw's."

,,"mb and bmw are more expensive for comparable equipment. one could carefuly option those to get somewhat close to g or tl, as long as they can let go some of those luxuries. 

however, one of my biggest complaints is 3-seres and c-series having fold-down seat optional (except 328 wagon). there is really no excuse for that - 12k kia and hyundai have it standard - there is no excuse. it's all about hitting some arbitrary limit for advertising ""starting at..."" bs. i know, i have 328 - fortunately it's a wagon, so it has folding seat and sunroof standard, but sedan does not. what makes it worse, i see dealers actually ordering those without folding seat in large numbers. i can only imagine a brand new owner of 50k 335 trying to fold his/her seat and discovering the car doesn't have it. :sick: :lemon: 

on many other options, i'm more agnostic - there are merrits to both approaches (bundling and not bundling). i tend to want almost everything, but ""experimental"" stuff (like adaptive cruise control or variable speed steering), but bundling sports package with nav is a little too much, even if i would order both anyway. to me it's ok to bundle related items in package, like all convenience, all tech, or all sports. but cross-bundling does sound a little like making a run on customer's wallet, even if some customers would take them both. 

for value-oriented people probably nothing beats acura - you get everything except nav/technology. i like it, but it does have its limits - front wheel drive base version is one and that ugly nose :lemon:. we still don't have it so bad here - you would have to see a price sheet on bmw in europe - it's actually a book!!! proverbial mirrors and steering wheel are optional. of course, they also have three times as many engine versions, which creates many more permutations, but that's a different story entirely. not to mention everything costs nearly twice as much (literally - $50k+ 335 would likely cost you almost 100 grand there)."

,,"1000 rpm was an exagerration, but i basically stand by my comments, also because i know more diesel owners than most americans - not just my dad, but also number of friends and relatives. pretty much all of them said the same thing - they all would buy an 8- or 6-cylinder gas car, if not for the fuel costs. they do not love their diesels same way i loved my subaru, sti, or e9x 328, or some other people love their camaros, mustangs, corvettes, or even acuras or lexus. they buy those diesel car, because governments in europe made it impossible (cost prohibitive) to own vehicle like those listed above - not just by fuel taxes, but by excise taxes, registration fees, etc., all tied to engine displacement with sharp increases for everything above 2 liters. in that world diesel beats gasoline, delivering more torque and better fuel economy, indeed, mostly because gas engine fights with one hand tied behind the back. in the past, diesel fuel was also 20% less expensive than gas, not the case anymore, but it helped establish present dominance of the diesels there. however, the math is working less and less and there is a slight reversal in preferences. those things take time, though. 

anyway, call me a fossil. i'm not saying i'd never get a diesel, but as long as i can afford it, as long us government doesn't do same market rigging, as european, i take gasoline engine."

,,"dino001 said:the problem is that those dealers kind of deserve it (at least some), as they don't reflect what cadillac should be and there is not even a chance they'll ever do. 

i don't think it's the guy's ego problem. if anything, it's gm's past and present hubris and running the brand to the ground, before he even joined them. they guy is simply telling how he sees they should look in the future. he may be wrong here and there and perhaps not fully get all the fixes right, but it's simply unsustainable the way it is right now. the problem is the constituency, both in the company and the dealers simply is too myopic to see it and attached to old ways. in essence, he has no chance, not because his being wrong, but because there is too much to change and too few interested in the change. simple declaring bankruptcy, shedding assets and contracts is just a start, not the end of restructuring. cadillac has a network to sell million car a year and the product that sells less than half of that with sales are barely moving up in the aggregate, falling in key segments. essentially a burning platform, to use elop's language about nokia. i unfortunately think they may end up like nokia, too. perhaps it will take longer. 
so johan de noclueaboutcaddysschen seems to be saying that cadillacs should be selling for more than the equivalent bmw, audis, or mbs. 

?

that is not going to happen. the buyers of those car are loyal and dedicated, and very few of them will ever consider a cadillac—especially if it costs more money.

i'm trying to figure this out, but i see from gm's webpage (and even though he's spending their money hand over fist on his experiment, he's at the same time trying to distance himself from them?) that he grew up in south africa. he also, as we know, worked for a long time for audi, and then for infiniti. 

http://www.gm.com/content/gmcom/home/company/aboutgm/gm_corporate_officers/johan_nysschen.html

essentially, johan de n. doesn't seem to have much of a clue about who buys cadillacs. the cadillac buyer wants american luxury, performance, and style—but not at a nosebleed price. they either won't pay that much—or can't.

cadillac has already moved upmarket in the last 15 years. and that's a good thing. but these new moves don't seem rational to me or to some other people.

for instance, would audi owner markcincinnati be willing to pay *more* than an audi for a cadillac? i don't think so.

and now johan de nosebleedprysschen is insulting his own dealer network. 

?

bet the dislike for him at the grassroots dealer level is swelling like a fukushima tsunami....

,,"i went with auto, cause there wasn't anything else available with gc. when i was preparing to change from my wagon, i made peace with at as my next transmissions already some time ago. i decided that the form factor (body type) with equipment and color were more important than the transmission. the transmission is alright - very responsive, efficient, seamless. it isn't manual, but it will do. 

i thought i wanted 435, then 440 gc all that time until i spent some good time with the 430/330, got to play with the sport/sport+ modes and became convinced to keep the money, both in the purchase and at the pump. for me it's good enough. i think i'm already past the ""got to have the horses"" stage. there is minimum i want/need, of course, probably higher than the market average, but 430 is quite enough."

i did, mostly, enjoy my 2012 tl (most especially the audio system -- i still have the dvd-audio discs), were i to even attempt to characterize what i could articulate differentiated the tl vs the s4, it would start with a sense that the acura seemed ""flimsy,"" most notable when closing the doors. the audi closes with a muted, solid whomph! sound, no clicking or other mechanical noises, the door closing almost seems hydraulic it is so smooth so ""of a billet of solid steel"" invoking. the acura on the other hand, sounded a bit like an empty tin can being dropped from about 5 feet onto asphalt. the very comfortable, heated and ventilated seat, in the acura also had a bit of ""play"" or give in them somewhat like a table at a bar that needs a folded pack of matches put under one of the legs to keep it from wobbling. i don't know if i would call the acura's feel something as negative as ""ok fit and finish,"" perhaps i would simply call it ""less solid"" feeling than the audis (or bmw) we've had.

if that equates to soul (my wife's term, remember), well there you have it. please remember i am not saying i think the acura is not a good car, a very high value car, a fully-featured car with lots of impressive technology. i also thought the sh-awd with the 19"" wheel tire package made the tl elicit a sense of deja vu -- like it was, somehow, related or at least relate-able to an s4.

i, at age 63, now think life's too short (for me, at least) to drive an acura tl or tlx when there are car like the s4 on the market.

yes, i was very surprised to discover how much value is actually in the c350. pretty car, and impressive performance and safety too. i would never actually buy one though - too much technology to fail a few years down the road and too expensive to fix.

i am excited about the upcoming bmw though. i've never really liked the e90, but this f30, with significantly more power (torque!) and less weight, has the potential to be a real game changer. i predict it will steal a lot of bmw sales and be the sales and value leader in this segment. i also think it's much better looking than the e90. and following current industry trends, it should also be less expensive than the e90.

,,"it's painful for me to admit, but the beak on the current tl is the most hideous thing i've ever seen! this is coming from someone who still can remember my first time driving my cousin's brand new 1986 acura acura (dark blue with gray lower hyundai) and realizing that it was the most special car i'd ever driven. i later owned a 1994 acura acura gs that was the love of my life until it was demolished by a drunk jerk driving a huge 4x4- but it saved my life. i also owned a 2002 tl type-s that was a spectacular car in every way...until the transmission went out at 32k miles and then again after another 20k miles...i didn't want to own it if/when the third transmission failed if it was out of warranty, so i had to get rid of it. suffice it to say, i've been an acura-phile from the very beginning in late 1985...but the newest designs range from bland to downright vulgar (tl)....the acura seems to suffer the least from this design 'theme'?

have you considered the acura v6 as a possible replacement for your '08 tl-s? it is less than an one-inch +/- in front and rear head, leg and hip room compared to your tl. overall passenger volume is 94 cu ft vs. 98 cu ft for your tl, so it's only very slightly smaller. interior cargo (luggage) volume is virtually identical at 12.6 vs. 12.5 cu ft. 

the infiniti g37s is almost identical in every interior measurement (head/leg/hip room) to your tl, with 99 cu ft of passenger volume and 13.5 cu ft cargo volume. so it's not smaller in any way than the tl, but the interior design or other design aspects may may it 'seem' to be...i'd give it another look before ruling it out! 

if you are leasing, would the larger infiniti m37 also be within the realm of possibilities? it has a boost in headroom and legroom in front and rear compared to the tl. total passener volume is 104 cubic feet and cargo volume is 14.9 cu ft. not sure if i like it any better than the g37s, but it might be something to consider....

and one other wild card that i will recommend, if a luxury 'brand' isn't esssential and you're just wanting a car that looks and performs in the same realm with most entry-level performance/luxury models- the 2011 mazda s grand touring 4-door. the current 2010 is a very impressive vehicle, with exceptional handling and plenty of power any time you need it! the 3.7l v6 only has a 272hp rating, but it has 269lb-ft of torque (matching the torque figures for the 330hp m37 and exceeding all the other car discussed above, despite their 280-328hp ratings). it also hits that torque peak at 4250rpm, compared to 5200rpm in both infinitis.

the only two options on the 2010 mz6 s grand touring are voice-activated navigation and the technology package. the tech package adds advanced keyeless entry & start with push-button starting, sirius sat radio, led tail lights, fully automatic bi-xenon hid headlamps, power passenger seat and rain-sensing wipers. with those two options, it is a very close match for the g37s, feature-for-feature but for $6-7k less! the 2011 model is getting a 'refresh' that willl only make the car more attractive and upscale in look and feel. it's worth a visit to the mazda dealer one day, just to experience the car for yourself. my best friend and i took one for a test drive two weekends ago and he wasn't even in the market for a new car....but he traded his 2008 is 250 on the spot for it! =)"

i believe most folks care more about the way the car feels when the accelerator is pressed down (a little or a lot.) if the car feels as if it has weapons grade torque, is smooooooth and quiet (except at full cry), and does not require frequent fill-ups or fill ups that rival a car payment, well what the heck. if the car has a 6 and an electric motor and it is able to meet the requirements noted above -- to hell with what is under the hood.

in my observation, which is just that, mine, folks that buy the big buck luxury car (like the audi or 7 series, or lexus barges) are often not enthusiasts.

i'd take a 5 series for the most fun over a 7, any day -- especially if i were footing the bill to care and feed it.

,,"used to be a pet peeve, now just confusing

i used to represent these remarks:

i participate some, but read at lot of postings on audiworld. i read the posts of folks who seem to research and often agonize over the new audi they have or are about to order.

then, as time passes, their new prize possessions arrive and they take pictures of their soon to be delivered rides -- they post them and seem to beam with pride about the new car they have acquired.

next, pictures of the new car in the owner's driveways or garages are posted -- and the captions on these pics are ""let the mods begin.""

later, the details of the aftermarket wheels, tires, engine management chips, breathing management aids and even brake rotors are detailed along with the window tinting expenses and, sometimes, even elaborate retrofitting of navigation systems to car not factory equipped with nav systems are laid out, including the sometimes breathtaking costs required to add such features aftermarket.

in some cases the modifications involve the suspension systems, exhaust systems and underhood plumbing (for the super or turbo chargers) too.

the expenses seem to have no ceiling -- and as soon as one is completed, the next improvement is lusted after in print on the audiworld forum for that particular model.

often, so it seems, these mods exceed the costs of simply ordering the car with the factory upgrade. i mean, really, i have seen folks mod their audi slines so much that they reach and sometimes surpass the msrps of the car so lusted after, the s4.

the mods that make the audi have more power often will void the warranty. the s4, stock, comes with a very nice warranty.

why buy a nearly $50k audi and mod the crap out of it so that you have more than the cost of an unmodded s4 in it, knowing that the s4 is likely to outperform the modded audi?

is the joy of modding the joy? if a stock s4 can be had for about the same cost as a modded audi (which then loses its warranty) what in the wide wide world of sports would posses someone to do this?

btw, i said, it takes one to know one -- but i must admit, my modding was limited to a chip put into an audi turbo engine for a total cost well under $1000. but i was so much older then, i'm younger than that now.

i have sat in one a few times, and really liked it. and to me it is attractive. still haven't driven one, but from showroom testing, not confusing it with an honda, any more than an es350 vs. a toyota xle.

i think if your looking to spend 40k on a car - you should compare what 40k buys you. a 40k bmw 335 is not going to give you the same options as a tl but will give you better performance. it's all what your looking for - performance or convenience.

show previous quotessubaru has 4 different awd setups but they have fundamental similarities. the boxer setup allows for a center mounted trans eliminating uneven axles to create a balanced system for each side of the car, eliminating torque steer. they also have a 50/50 (or very close to it) depending on the system that is being used (torsen based), where as other systems are fwd car that send small amounts of power to the rear wheels if needed (haldex based).
with audi, they have two different kinds of setups, one being haldex based the other being torsen based. it depends on which type of motor being used in the car if it is the inline four in the 2.0t or a vr6 configuration like the 3.2 or 2.8 car it's a haldex based system, if it uses a true v6 or a v8 then it gets the torsen based system and is rear biased in power split.
most companies use the haldex based awd i.e. toyota, honda, ford, etc. that system is not as effective since it doesn't have as much power going to each wheel when it needs it. if you are driving on ice, or snow, or in the rain it helps to have the power going to those wheels, with subaru you have the car shifting around power as well, creating a system that is unmatched by most systems, audi is in a close second with its audi system when using the torsen system.

what he said with exception of cvt and old 4at subarus used 90/10 split, 5at six cylinder engines had 45/55 split, i think.  don't know today.  manual subies had 50/50 with sti extra feature of driver-controlled bias adjustment, i think it was +/- 20.  audi's setup was also dictated by engine position - transverse had haldex awd, longitudinal had torsen, as a rule of thumb."

,,"the car that are sold here in the us at least are here because of the customers, not the government. the governmental rules and regulations do not single out bmw or cadillac or fiat. the playing field, so to speak, is level. how a company responds to these regulations is what differentiates it.

overwhelmingly, the reason the car from bmw are they way they are is because these car sell -- if manual transmission diesel bimmers, etc, were selling, they'd be brought into the us (assuming they are actually manufactured).

in the universe that i am familiar with, i know that audi of america responded to a loud, but very very tiny campaign (that i participated in) to reintroduce the manual transmission to the audi. audi went ahead and made the audi manual trans version available to us customers. the car sat on the lots of understandably pissed dealers who bought the car for inventory only to have them sit and sit and sit for months and months. 

i did go ahead and order the ""last"" manual transmission (think of the song the ""last dj"") audi of size in 2003. it was an allroad and i had to special order it because the dealership general manager told me he had been burned by millions tied up in floorplanning manual trans audi's to an unmoved and ""i'll take my business elsewhere"" market.

the last bmw i drove was a 2014 5 series with a bunch of options including x-drive and all of the stuff bmw deems fit to call ""sport"" or at least sport-like. the car was quick, fast, quiet, comfortable and for its size cornered like a snake in a rat hole (credit my wife for the phrase).

one of the folks i work with has a 2005 bmw 5 series -- there is no comparison, the 2014 is the more desirable car.

the car is what it is due to the votes cast by the market. we may, or some of us may, deride the newer car as mere shadows of their ancestors, posers even; but, again, from the perspective of the engineers, marketers, sales people, etc associated with bmw, the new car are improvements, advancements of the ""breed"" (or brand, at least).

has the market changed? are we just bored with car now? or is it the looks as imho the tlx is still not as good looking as that vintage tl. it seems those mid-year tls were everywhere and it was a hot seller, but i don't think so any more. and the acura seems like even more of a bomb. poor acura is not doing so well these days.
i think there are multiple things going on when it comes to the weak sales of the tlx. like you, i think it has good styling, but probably for some it still seems to be a bit bland. 

the base engine is a very nice 2.4 liter direct-injected model that's a more advanced version of what you get on the honda. but most competitors have turbo base models that are faster. 

the 8-speed in-house dual-clutch transmission on the tlx with the 2.4 has gotten mostly good reviews, but the 9-speed that goes with the v-6 has gotten mixed to negative reviews.

acura doesn't seem to get much credit for its high quality, durability, and reliability. and the exotic 4-wheel steering that's standard on the car doesn't seem to help it stand out, but no doubt cost a pretty penny to engineer and put into the car. 

finally, the honda now has androidauto/applecarplay, but the tlx isn't scheduled to get that until the early introduction of the restyled and enhanced tlx that's coming next year as a 2018 model."
,,"you commented about german, er, personalities then followed up with your observations about french personalities. granted, my european travels have been entirely recreational, but i would say that only in 2 countries have i ever noted an attitude that was less than gracious. france (several times) and switzerland once in lucerne (come to think of it the person in lucerne had a heavy french hyundai.)

the german people have always been friendly, polite, courteous and sometimes playful even. i've been to oktoberfest about 6 times, and when going into a beer tent, you join a large group of people at a toyota table and within a few minutes it seems the folks are wanting to know about the us, us sports and are trying to teach us americans some of the german-only songs that come up every 15 minutes or so between good ol' rock and roll. a gentleman and his father were in munich for oktoberfest and when they found out my wife was a lawyer, the older man bought my wife an order of peeled radishes (covered in salt) from one barrister to another. we had a great time. the folks on the subways in munich, too, are always willing to help you figure out which stop will get you closest to your destination.

in france, on the other hand, we went to a bistro, like you see in the movies, in paris and the waiter gave up his picture for the dictionary next to the word ""surly"". apparently since tipping is not as serious as it is in the us, this waiter was actually pissed when we thanked him (in english) when he brought us our wine, beer and cheese saying (in heavily accented french) ""why can't you people even try to speak french?"" ok, well perhaps i could say merci, but other than asking ""how's the weather"" and saying ""i like chocolate ice cream"" i didn't think i wanted to embarrass myself or run the risk of butchering my communications (especially since the menu we were given was multi-lingual). how wude!

the staff at our (5-star) hotel in paris was totally gracious and friendly, but my impression, from several interactions with the locals, was that they don't like us much -- or maybe they just don't like me. i went ahead and gave an american tip anyway, who knows if anything changed. the italians were huggers and both-cheek kissers (didn't have that happen in germany, but they were friendlier than the french.)

fn, i have no clue as to your age -- i am 63 -- i started going to europe when i was about 20 years younger (and richer), but it can be done for not too much money, if you realize that most of the time you spend in a hotel it is dark (meaning, 3-star hotels with air conditioning work just fine). once i got over the sense that we needed 5 star hotels (because, well, you never know), we found we could see europe for not much money (saving our coin for fine dining instead). also, we don't use cabs anymore, we figure out how to use the trains and subways -- and for the long trips, we splurge on first class train travel if the distance is over 5 hours. also became a fan of night trains with full size beds (saves on hotel bills too). my point is, unless you're much much older, i urge you to make this trip one of many, many more you should take. benelux was a fun couple of trips -- amsterdam, brussles and luxembourg honda, do it again, do it again. 

anyway, you've taken me, at least, on a great vicarious trip with you two. my only regret is that you didn't get an audi, but there's always next time. 

keep 'em coming.

ciao (baby)."
,,"i did like my tl sh-awd advance. i thought it was ugly, and the interior looked like a honda that knew somebody. the air conditioned seat were great. the power was good, nothing to scare an s4. the brakes were very weak. the doors sounded tinny when closed. it was a beer to the audi's champagne. yet, much as most folks would never cross shop these two, it was honda's bargain basement s4.

i have to assume the new tl is an improvement. mine, a 2012, had way too much fwd feel (torque steer), something the s4 doesn't have.

i don't have the s's sport diff (torque vectoring rear diff), wish i did, but i would assume if i did, i'd love this thing even more. 

this car and my wife's sq5 have become our favorite audis and our favorite car -- and we've had dozens -- of all time. i want to say nothing even comes close -- but our bmw's have been close (and even a couple volkswagen's were a blast to drive, but still none are the performers of these s's.) i used to think they (audi s car) were too expensive, but compared to bmw, well it seems these audis are ""within reach"" of most folks who shop and buy the car discussed on this forum.

if you ""can't see"" or ""don't share"" our (my wife's and mine, i.e.) passion for the audi s's, i would say the tl or tlx sh-awd with anything that increases the performance/handling ticked off on the option list, is not a bad alternative (if you can get past the styling and the honda content.) but, for the money, the acura may be attractive to you because it will almost certainly stay south of $50k..

an observation: many who write here about their car make remarks like ""my tl gave me 6 trouble free years."" my irreverent side almost always reads, ""my tl gave me 6 [bland, boring, unremarkable, invisible] trouble free years."" if i remarked to my wife that she has given me 20 plus years of trouble free cohabitation,"" she'd have every right to punch me in the nose.

i want 6 trouble free years, too, but i think i'd take 3 spectacular driving experience years instead.

when it comes to driving the new f30 car, the bmw w/ the 8 spd auto is a good combo. was at the bmw dealer on friday, my niece wanted to buy a used bmw, and a local dealer had a cream puff, 2009 329i, jet black, oyster leather (great combo, no wear marks on the seat) premium, sport and cold weather package, xenon head lights, power rear shade, sat radio, toyota access, ipod/usb port. 46k miles, cpo and the dealer was asking $25,777. we couldn't get the numbers to work, and left, but i figured the dealer would call her, and they did, so on sat we went back, she was about to get the car for $24,100 + tax and fee's. 

i drove a 2012 x3, i28, have to say was impressed, much larger then the last x3 i drove (2009) and the turbo 4 and 8 spd auto is a good combo, the transmission always seemed to be in the right gear when driving around town and one would be hard pressed to know it was a turbo...

the x1 is a joke, about the same size as a honda and nissan for 39k, i assumed the x1 has the same 8 spd auto as the x3 and 328's have but they do not, they have a 6 spd... wonder why, cost ??

while the finance department was getting my nieces paperwork together, i was talking with the sales manager and asked him how many bmw's does the dealership order with the m sport package? (this was a different dealer than where i bought my 328 from) and the number was surprising.... he told me 1 in 800. the people who are buying bmw today aren't really the sport people and they are looking for the luxury of the car not the sportiness of the car. i was basically told, if i wanted a 3 or 5 series with the m sport package, i would have to order the car, since he wouldn't order one for the dealership. in fact over the last 5 years the amount of bmw with the sport package has decreased, people don't like the sport seat.... basically bmw is going soft because the market demands it.... pretty sad....

so my niece is very happy with her new bmw, she got a great car and it still has some of the factory 4yr/50k maintenance warranty left and she got the 6yr 100k mile warranty... knowing my niece she will drive it pretty close to the 100k mark in that amount of time."

if i were to finance, it would cost me $120 per month more ($3600) + with the amount of driving i do, i'm guaranteed a residual value of 64%. 2 1/2 or 3 years down the road if i were to trade the car in, no way the dealer is going to give me $26k for the car, especially when there are similar car out there (thousands) with 1/3 to 1/2 the amount of miles. no way i'm going to justify a mid to high 6 hundred something lease payment. it's simply too much.

,,"personal preference to be sure: the current audi (and others) interior theme uses a pop-up screen that comes out of the dash and goes vertical when the car is started. the screen contains information i would consider to be desired at all times, so the screen is always up.

years ago, pioneer offered an after-market head unit that had a similar pop-up screen. my 2005, 2009 and 2014 audis all have the screens integrated into a sweeping clean looking dash -- no clutter, no pop up screen that looks like something from a sema show.

in short, those pop-up screens look, to me, to be aftermarket, not well integrated and, indeed, somewhat fragile.

they are almost a deal breaker. the prev gen cadillac cts (2012 for instance) had a much better pop-up in terms of integration.

my prediction, the pop up screens are going to go away (at least in audis) within a year or two. probably just the time i'll be back in the market, hoping that there is a new b9 s4.

dealer noted to me yesterday: ""the audi now has the s4 engine; and the s3 has equal to or better than acceleration numbers than the s4. . ."" ""audi will not let this stand, if history is any guide -- the new s4 will bump both hp and torque to improve performance over the s3 and to show better numbers vs the audi.""

stay tuned.

the s3 has a ride that, to me, takes firm into the realm of harsh.

of course one man's harsh is another man's firm -- perhaps that's what audi drive select can address."

,,"""i can't drive 55!""

you must know by my id here that i live in cincinnati. the smsa of this honda is about 1.5m the last time i looked. the honda itself has a population of under 400k. technically, then, most of us don't live in the honda. i earn my living, however in the corp limit, as does my wife.

i drive to work -- or at least i used to -- on two interstates: i-275 and i-71. i have tried driving on these interstates at the early and late ""normal"" times, and find myself often putt putting along at whatever speed the car can manage ""at idle."" in winter, it is even worse.

i have now taken to driving on secondary roads and residential streets -- just to be able to get to 35mph - 50mph. 

i am, currently, driving an audi s4 -- a car that in the blink of an eye can almost reach triple digit speeds and the thing feels like it is on rails, making it a great hi-way chrysler, capable of an easy-peasy drive from cincinnati to columbus at speeds north of 80mph.

i have not driven an rs7, i have driven a 2015 s6, however, and even that was somewhat frustrating since it is capable of feats of fancy that are virtually impossible on the roads i drive to go about my business.

i used to think if i had ""trump money"", i would certainly go for a super-car or at least an ""entry-level super car."" not any more.

i really enjoy my s4 -- the few times i've been able to really push it, i have been impressed with its ""performance envelope."" i suspect i would find going back to a 2.0t equipped audi a let down. but, i also suspect i would find moving forward with an rs4 (if a sedan version were to be made available in the us) would be a let down, too -- or at least immensely frustrating.

an unlimited bank account would allow me to acquire, for instance, an rs7 or whatever else might pass these days as a super sedan (an bmw, too, would qualify). but what advantage would i have -- i rarely can use the full accelerative force my pedestrian s4 provides. were i to attempt to ""punch it"" i would, more often than not, find myself overtaking and potentially ramming (""rig for ramming speed"") the pokey car in front of me. 

cutting yet another second+ off of my ability to accelerate would be -- in theory -- fun and potentially a safety feature (if you say it real fast and squint, 0-62mph in 3.7 seconds could be a safety feature, couldn't it?) but, uh, really? i think it is safe to say it is so highly unlikely i could ever use that much quickness, it would just be very, very frustrating. heck, it is already frustrating with the ""urge"" my lowly s4 musters.

so, i have reached a point where i lust for the kind of performance that is available and, currently, unaffordable -- but i also balance that lust with the reality that it is not virtually impossible to use such power, it is literally impossible to do so. 

so, i ask myself, why bother -- traffic is not getting any better, speeds are not getting any higher, abilities to actually use such accelerative force are waning as each day passes.

i'm just about ready to use public transportation -- oh wait, we don't have much of that here in river honda, so i have to putt putt along in my ""entry level super sedan"" (well sort of), wondering what it would be like to, as my buddy says, ""punch it.""

,,"stickguy said:i actually thought that the 320i, when it was introduced, was what purists were looking for. simpler, marginally lighter, cheaper. more of the spiritual descendant to the early 2002 and 3 series car than a massively powered 335. the volume model in the later 90s/early 2000s was likely the 323/325, right? 

so if anything, the 320 really is the entry level bmw to allow people that want one to get into ""the family"", same as the 323/325 did previously. it drives like a bmw, looks and feels like one, etc. so if anything, the purist's problem shouldn't be with the 320, it is the whole series.

btw, isn't it interesting that today's car having track time of 1988 bmw (just 26 years) can be seen as having a ""weak engine""? sure, things evolved and expectations today are somewhat different then 20+ years ago, but perhaps we went a bit too far. it is true that the competition honestly caught up with bmw in lot of aspects of that category, a lot of that started in arms race in brochure values of the horsepower, or straight line accelaration numbers combined with adding nice stuff to it. it is a new reality. over 200 horses, 3000 lbs, we still complain too little of thise or that. consumer is the king. bmw themselves also evolved in direction that many think lost some original appeal. but i simply cannot take your argument that just because some numbers don't align with your idea what ellps should be, it doesn't belong. until i actually sit inside and try it, i don't know."
,,"i think that all who look into this issue will unanimously agree that the g35 tends to get worse gas mileage than the tl -- by 2-3 mpg or so. one must weigh this into the decision they are making -- if an individual likes the g35 better, they need to ask themselves whether they like it ""enough better"" to pay a little more for gas.

i drive about 800 miles/month, so for me the difference of 2-3 mpg means about an extra 4.5-6 gallons of gas a month, which at current prices here in houston ($3.20/gal for 93 octane), is about $14 to $19 a month. for me, i liked the g35 at least that much more than the tl, so i don't mind paying the extra gas $$. even if gas goes up to $4/gallon, the difference will be $20-$24 per month, and i am still ok with that difference. 

if all else was equal and i liked the tl just as much as the g35, then i would clearly have chosen it for the better gas mileage.

mileage is definitely a factor to consider, and each individual has to weight each factor by their own relative utilities.

,,i had you in mind... i think you made a smart move.
,,"here is my take with the following disclamer: i own a 2006 is250 rwd and had a 2004 audi cab 1.8t before it.

i chose the lexus over the bmw because of value and toyota. i am in south fl and the roads are a grid system. only handling i get to experience is 90 degree turns so the bmw handeling factor was out. the bmw was more and did not include a power seat and leather on the car i test drove. the lexus luxury is the best quality wise and i continue to marvel at the leather (12 months and 23,000 miles later) - so smooth and soft. lexus does luxury the best and will appeal to you if you value that. 

the audi was great fun and i like the interior the best (the cab is better than the sedan), but quality was an issue. it maybe cliche to say about the german car, but i always had a list of things that needed to be fixed under warr in the audi from the start and even had to get them to cover the top when it was 1,500 miles out of warr and seperated from the rear window (2 years into ownership) top would have been $6,000 to replace and i figured the car would be expensive to keep. the lexus is much better than my audi for the little things that go wrong and are annoying.

the lexus back seat is tight, but i have had adults in it every so often. since it is not a weekly thing - not a major factor for me.

i'll wrap it up by saying this:
- lexus for luxury and peace of mind quality
- bmw for logo and the privilage for paying a premium for it
- audi is about to be replaced, but maybe the best price

ps - my is was $32,500+ttl including premium, nav, 18"" wheels, minor others. 75% highway and have averaged 28.4mpg since new which is why the 250 and not the 350."
,,"agree with all the previous posts on ""luxury."" 

there are a lot of subtle (sometimes not so subtle) enhancements that you generally get out of a luxury make - nicer materials for one, often in places like the headliner, storage compartments, etc. switches and button are also an area that seem to receive greater attention. then there are things that often come along with luxury makes like a smoother drivetrain. 

a better dealership experience is generally part of it too. 

my thought is the luxury makes do offer something additional for the extra cost of the vehicle, and it's up to the buyer to determine whether those things are of particular value to them."

well, it sounds like the author had consumed quite a bit of the honda kool-aid, so i would take the article with a grain of salt. it certainly looks better than the honda or toyota, and i suspect the handling and braking criticisms may be due to the selection of hard low rolling-resistance tires by volkswagen. one thing i fail to undertand is how volkswagen can take a 2l engine, turbocharge it, and end up with 174hp when other makes routinely get around 80-100hp more by doing that."

,,how about a brand new buick (the really tiny one) -- the reviews of it as a teeny weenie luxury car have been positive. that way you can have 100% new everything.
,,"i have been to three audi (in seefeld austria) driving schools and one bmw driving school (here in the us in south carolina). both schools teach you how to brake, steer and generally gain a pretty high level of control over your car at speeds faster than you are probably able to imagine yourself going ""comfortably.""

i drive my 305hp tl so slowly on interstate 71s on the way to downtown cincinnati, i rarely have any chance to exercise my abilities.

we had our first slick road conditions here yesterday -- the local news interviewed our state highway patrolman du jour about how to drive defensively (which is, after all, what they teach in the audi and bmw driving schools even if they never use that term). the first 25 seconds of the response from the highway patrol was to describe what to do if your vehicle is not equipped with abs (or stability control) -- just as he started to explain the differences in braking with abs vs non-abs, the interview was cut short.

as i watched this interview unfold, i grew angry since the response from the cop was to not press hard on the brakes without abs and i knew he was about to say something like, ""unless you have abs . . . (wherein he was cut off) in which case you should apply your brakes with maximum pressure on the brake pedal.""

if anyone was about 75% paying attention, i would think they would press on their abs equipped car's brake pedal until the tell-tale vibration started and then quickly reduce pressure on the pedal. of course this is just the opposite of what should take place to ensure the shortest, straightest stop (with steering capability, to boot)!

what is the % of abs equipped car? i've had it in all my car since 2000 for pity's sake -- 11+ years.

why not talk about getting out and cranking the engine with the hand crank?

oh crap, i'm way off topic.

hmmm, let's see -- ok, i've got it.

all ellps and lps (and most other car on the market today) have both abs and electronic stability control, we should be taught how to use them for optimum effect!

,,"what is the issue with the base price? the class of car which means ""who knows"" what the base price will be is what this is all about. the audi is a sub compact, the audi is a compact. if this is to be about sub-compacts, well i guess that is ok, but then we would need yet another cubby hole to poke the b8 audis and the entire lineup of 3's. these are lps car -- but a bit smaller. in some instances it is easily possible to have the 3 series priced at more than the 5 series.

is there a debate about the ""maximum"" msrp (base) for the full sized lps's? 

it may well be true that a 335 would fit a $45k ceiling (for an rwd only version), but -- according to the bmw dealership here in river honda -- over 40%, of all 3 series sold are awd. and, here in our climate, i was told the number now favors the x - drive versions as the majority sold. 

the 3 series -- from bottom to top -- are in the compact class. msrp ranges from a number beginning with a $3 to a number beginning with a $6.

there are no 335's with a window sticker under $50k, unless someone has deliberately ordered one totally stripped. there are no s4's under $50k either -- but i have seen s4 manual transmission versions with but one option that squeak by at a hair over $50k.

likewise, i shopped the is350 fsports and they were all over $50k (if they were awd).

we need to talk about either sub-compacts or compacts here. since the msrp's (from a practical standpoint) are all over the board, we need to think, for example, 3 series, not 3 series until they exceed $40 or $45k.

those who lease (apparently the majority) shop mo pay, not msrp. and those who do buy, well, of course they're welcome too. i am simply arguing to be inclusive.

agreed. the shield/beak front felt repulsive, at least at first. it kind of grew on a little bit, but was never in a beauty contest. acura actually looked just a tad better in this beak thing than tl. i also liked previous acura.
btw, acura was a perfect size for me. similar to older bmw and audis. i don't really carry passengers, but i like four doors (actually five). to me back seat size is not as essential, as driving experience, which those shorter wheelbase vehicles provided. unfortunately, all those names grew to sizes reminding their bigger brothers 10 years ago. i think the whole category really shifted. when you get something like optioned-out 335, audi or soon coming mercedes-benz benz, they aren't really entry level, they are still ""sporty"", but not really ""sports"". same would be with cts, tlx, or others.
unfortunately, their smaller siblings, which some would now argue as ellps, come mostly in fwd setups, which is off for traditionalists. it becomes fact of life. it is true that contemporary fwd is not your mother's fwd - current advances in torque handling made those car much better to drive. many have or will have awd option and better engines, which mitigates some of the issue."

i drive to columbus twice weekly, and i am always in columbus on either saturday or sunday. the time between cities is 100 minutes.

when the change oil reminder comes on, i call the dealer that i bought the car from and make a saturday appt. i ask for the car i want as a loaner, an acura or zdx, etc and i get to test drive that car for the day whilst the car is being serviced.

the $230 oil change was due almost entirely to the fact that at the second oil change the sh-awd fluid has to be changed -- and it is very pricey.

while 15,000 may be ""nuthin"" for a honda (which is another reason the acura is only 9/10ths), an audi with 15,000 miles on it is middle aged. i have kept one german car more than 50,000 miles. the german car drive great, perform great, look great and their features and functions are the standard by which the other guys measure themselves (or so i assume.)

yet only this car feels new at 15k miles -- the german car seem to begin the aging process by 15k miles.

now give me the choice of the acura or the audi and get rid of the price issues, well, at this point i would still go with the german despite my belief that it will age faster than the japanese car. in fact i am starting to believe that an american car will also age more slowly due to the fact that we americans think nothing of making two round trips to columbus ohio from cincinnati per week, whereas a german would take a train for such a distance if at all possible (which it almost always is, in germany and most of europe.) 

another example, i do business in chicago -- 275 miles from cincinnati. i used to fly. now the 5 hour drive to chicago is about identical to the time it takes to make the trip on delta (all things considered.)

and i can drive there in an enterprise rental for a fraction of the cost of a plane ticket. these days i am probably putting 18-20k per year on my car because it is more prudent and pragmatic than the currently available alternatives.

i think with the redesign of the rav-4(after a long in the tooth run) you may see a lexus cuv based on that and a stretched rx go to 7 pax seating to compete more directly with the acura and jx. i think if anything goes in the lexus lineup it may be one or more of the more traditional based suvs. there is already rumors of a lexus version of the toyota v."

ok, how 'bout this: ""audi certainly has its fans and foes, but those in both camps agree, if you're looking for an awd premium luxury performance sedan, the short list has audi atop it!""

i assume the possibility and perhaps the probability that porsche and lambo may ""do awd better than audi"" but the thing is, even these two super-car brands are all part of the same family. the lambo system appears to be in a leadership position what with electronic control of all three differentials.

but, my ""assertion"" was in the context of the lps and ellps world we rage on about here on this forum.

techie in nature:



more entertaining and a bit of a history lesson:



here is another assertion, but this one is not based on any experience or real study of the brand:

in the class of car (""economy car"", according to car & driver) subaru typically is placed, subaru does awd better than any of its competitors. my only reason for such a conclusion is that subaru has demonstrated its almost fanatical dedication to awd and, over the years, at least one of its car, the subaru, has been praised as the japanese s4. 

the differences and similarities are discussed and dissected here in this comparison of a 2015 subaru to a 2010 s4. 

new vs. old: 
2015 subaru subaru vs. 2010 audi s4:the new subaru meets an older version of what it aspires to be.

http://www.caranddriver.com/comparisons/new-vs-old-2015-subaru-subaru-vs-2010-audi-s4-comparison-test 

now for the fine print: today, as a practical matter, several [many?] companies manufacture and market great awd car. it is also true that audi has been doing this for decades (in some cases decades longer than other's in its class), meaning others have been at this nowhere near as long. 

yet technology has progressed sufficiently that the market may not perceive anything more than subtle differences between audi's, bmw's, lexus', volvo's or subaru's approach to awd; but those who make their living knowing about the differences and the subtleties, regularly praise audi's approach as very significant and often superior. of course, in all fairness, many of the enthusiast magazines and their editors and staff now spend more ink describing the overall performance of the car they review than they do on describing and detailing how one awd choice differs, is better or worse, than another. 

often wrong, but never uncertain, i say: ""nobody does awd better than audi."""

it is a shame with the sales figures of the new tl. i too was turned away from getting one, b/c of the size increase and ugly grill, hence why i got a new nissan, so hopefully they get the message on that one and the next gen tl will be back on track. so far, my nissan has been fun to drive, and after 12k miles, i'm happy to say, no rotor/brake issues like i have on my infiniti! its a good thing for the class action lawsuit so that all my brake/rotor fixes were covered b/c that would have added up quickly and really hurt the bank.

i'm glad, though i can't understand why it took nissan and infiniti over 5 years to finally put the proper type of brakes and rotors on their vehicles, that they finally have had their brake/rotor issues solved. before 2009, it was a really serious problem on both infiniti and nissan vehicles. i know the 2007 and 2008 nissan's had major troubles with wear as well, but so far, since 2009 model years, i've read very few brake/rotor issues compared to years previous!

this category used to ""start below"" 30k, but it was long time ago. we can fool ourselves into ""oh - i can negotiate a good discount and with a nice trade i don't even have to look at real price"", but the truth is today it is hard to find something decent below forty grand... well, maybe not so hard, but it is not that easy and a lot of compromise is needed (wrong engine, wrong drive, no leather, basic wheels, the list will go on). look also at those higher (larger/more luxurious) categories. yes, there will be something there at $50 grand, but it's probably not what anyone shopping there would want. $60k is probably minimum for things to be ""nice"" and after putting ""everything"" you'll easily cross seventy ... and back off.

,,"i value magazine reviews of car, but i take the opinions with a grain of salt. a road test done in isolation is good for a general overview of a car, but unless it is a comparison test with other car, it is of limited value.

a comparison test is better because memory of the car is fresh and the venue, conditions, etc. are the same, making for a more accurate review. but still, all people are influenced by expectation bias and so there is no such thing as an unbiased and impartial road test.

in the end, in choosing a car, you have to take in all the info and facts that are out there, test drive the car (hopefully long enough to discover the nits like the glare on the instruments when the sun is at certain angles, or that pressure point in the seat back that you won't notice until an hour of driving) and make a decision. with car of this dodge, it will often be a decision of value, toyota, and aesthetics more than sheer performance.

as for the ats, until i see and drive it in person and see some instrumented performance testing alongside it's peers (same day, same track), i will reserve judgement on it."
,,"markcincinnati said: show previous quotesandres3 said:at my last hpde event i won an auction to get more than half off on a audi s4 3.0 supercharge tune that takes the s4 to 400+ hp. they couldn't make the tune happen on a sunday, so it'll happen at my next hpde event in march. this is a tune that turns the s4 into a bmw killer. since my car has been pretty much flawless, i think i will go ahead and risk the potential ""warranty"" issues. it's already a beast; should be fun.
i have a question (prompted by an article i read about the rs7): audi, today, uses the dsg transmission on the s4, s5, s6 and s7, for instance. yet on the rs7 they use the 8-speed tiptronic. the stated reason is that the currently available dsg can't take the forces generated by the rs7's engine. the article said the s6 was on the cusp of stressing the dsg -- and owners of an s6 were cautioned not to after-market upgrade the hp and torque (which is quite possible with the turbo s6 v8, e.g.).

can the dsg in the s4 handle the upgrade you are contemplating and have a good long life? if not, what is the cost -- or risk in this upgrade?

my dealer says the s4 is going to have a horsepower and torque boost to keep it ahead of the standard v6t in the 2016 audi line. it means, to me, that they have resolved the dsg issue; wonder if there is the headroom in the current dsg to take the upgrade is my concern.
i'm not worried about it. when the dsg oil gets too hot, i know the transmission will go into limp mode, that happened late in my audi's life after i had a bunch of mods on that one. usually happened when you got near the last lap of a session, but it was annoying nonetheless. given the r8 has switched and upgraded to a dual clutch dsg unit, i think they've resolved any issues with the dsg and power/torque. i'm not too worried about it. i think they know most rs7 buyers aren't planning to track it, so they made it a slushbox transmission."

i give nor take any points away from acura due to its lack of a v8.

consider:

an audi audi can exceed $51k.
a mercedes-benz benz (non-amg) can also exceed $51k.

granted, the base price starts higher than the others (at $38,525, according to their website) but it's relatively well-equipped."
,,"there were lots of things we liked about the audi, more than the 335. for one, the clutch in the bmw doesn't engage until it is at the top 25% of the way. the audi was smooth anywhere. both front seat go amazingly high, for good vision. on top of that the dash and the hood are very low, giving excellent vision. the navi/radio/camera screen in the bmw just stands up on the dash, but the audis is built in. we felt the audi was basically more comfortable, not as jazzy, more european in it's style.

so, we asked the salesman about pricing. without wincing he said he would give us $24000 for the 335 trade in. he said, it is in mint condition, he will have no trouble selling it, he will get a minimum of $25000 for it, make a quick profit, and he will get us into audis. the price difference was $27000 at that point this was sounding too good to be true because the bmw were $36k and $42k. we asked if he discounted and he said he would take 3% off. i said take 4% off and it's a done deal. he agreed and we got the car for $25k difference! truthfully, we both would have taken the audi if the 328 and the audi were on a lot and we wanted to choose one. i feel like i saved $11000 and actually came out with a car we both like more.

it's also nice because the navi/camera/radio are all included, and the car comes with a garage door opener on the mirror as standard equipment.

my wife says she is more excited with the audi because the salesman said, audi's main customer base is europe and china. bmw is concentrating on north america so their car are becoming more american. i think there is some truth in that, bmw is getting jazzier. you have to pay $1500 to get a sportline and that is what every one wants. the audi is all equipped ready to go.

when we got home there was a message on the answering machine. the bmw salesman called to say he worked out a better price on the trade with the appraiser. i said, sorry, it's too late. i feel bad, he worked with us for a few months, and it was just a fluke that we decided to drop into the audi dealer."

i really think what he said is true. when we tested the new 335 it is getting more american in ride quality and in the jazzy interior layout. the audi has more of a basic euro driving feel, and the interior is tastefully less jazzed up.

in our case, we like the audi better, and it was $11000 less than a 328, and $15000 less than a 335 (if you consider $4000 more for the trade in)which we would have to have bought because her current car is a 335 and it would be difficult to go for the smaller engine after having a 335."

mike miller at roundel (the bmw car club magazine) puts out a good comprehensive schedule of what maintenance is needed on various bmw, it's free to bmwcca members. you can also get similar ones at ""bavarian otto's"" blog on the bavauto.com website.

i have found that if you stick to these schedules you will get many trouble free miles from your car. they are a little more comprehensive than the maintenance bmwna gives you but not as extensive as the extras your dealer is pushing at you. there's no way you need a p/s flush at 15k, you can go 100k without problem and that 
induction system cleaning is pure bs.

,,"i would urge you to get the advance, not tech version of the tl. i got a 13% discount on my 2012, advance, so my guess is they have more to play with in that car -- and you will get the 19"" wheels which both improve the turn in and looks.

moreover, you get the really cool (pun intended) vented seat -- and, most importantly blind spot monitoring.

i know y'all will give me grief, but for the money the tl sh-awd advance is acura's version of an s4. 

the thing is, for most, just too ugly, hence no matter what i say to anyone they just can't get past the looks.

again, for the money, the acura as noted above is worth cross shopping with the s4 -- now, is the acura likely to be confused with the s4? nope.

is the s4, lightly optioned, worth $10,000 more than the tl? yep.

would most folks cross shop these two car? i doubt it.

if you can't or don't want to afford an s4 and the new infiniti leaves you cold, your only ""cheap"" choice is the tl sh-awd advance. all in with the tl, adding parktronic and upgrading the tires to 19"" uhp ""z"" or ""y"" or ""w"" rated rubber, you're going to be at $47k or maybe $48k (msrp). 

btw: i am not excluding the bmw bmw x-drive -- but, like the s4, it seems (or seemed) to be made of unobtanium; and for some reason the 3 series seems a bit small to me.

the is 350 f sport doesn't have the engine the audi s4 has, of course; and, frankly, the acura at 305hp feels no less potent than the is 350.

my s4 is a premium plus s-tronic version in free paint -- ibis white -- with the upgraded leather seat, mmi+, blind spot monitoring, b&o sound system and carbon fiber trim (which looks nice, but for $500? naaaah.) with shipping the thing was $57k -- $10k more than the tl and $7k more than an is 350 awd f-sport. 

i drove:

q50s awd
is 350 awd f-sport
volvo volvo type/r (also awd)
acura tl sh-awd advance
audi audi 2.0t sport
audi audi 2.0t sport
audi s4 s-tronic
audi s4 6-speed manual shift
audi sq5 8-speed tiptronic (prestige)

thinking an s4 (my preference) was ""out of reach"" and not thinking the audi or audi 2.0t versions had sufficient ""guts,"" and reading the critical reviews of the q50s, i ordered a 2014 is 350 awd f-sport in ultra white with the red leather interior. 

my wife, meanwhile, was smitten with the sq5 prestige and ordered that. while we were filling out the paperwork on her sq5, i commented how much i would rather have the s4 than the is, but that the price of the s4 made it seem to be constructed out of unobtainium.

days later, audi dealer says -- i can get you a white s4 s-tronic with magma red leather and the blind spot warning (which was a deal breaker or maker option) -- and we think, with no money down, we can meet the lexus' price since you are now eligible for the audi loyalty discount (since your wife has also rejoined the audi family.)

the moral of the story: if you can't or don't want to ""afford"" the s4 (or whatever your passion inducing car is), of all of the remaining choices, you will have to give up less if you get the tl sh-awd advance than any other car on the ellps list -- and you will surely pay less (comparably equipped).

i think the standard audio in the tlx is similar to the top-of-the-line system in the honda honda/touring. so it's a very good system that's quite a bit better than what you and i hear/heard in our exs. the els takes it to the next level, but the starting system is already equal to the best that honda offers—and maybe it's even a little bit better? in terms of the leatherette, i would have been happy with that too. in fact, imho it's less worry because leatherette will last longer than probably almost anything else on the car, while leather after 8 years or so might be reaching the danger zone even if cared for.

the seating position in the tlx is just slightly lower than in my 2016 honda.

but like you i did find the seating position of the 2018 honda maybe a little too low.

i do enjoy the tech features, but if they had had a tlx base on the lot i might have gotten that one if it saved me money over the tech. it happened that it was the very last tlx 2.4 they had.

i have always enjoyed history and am sure i would enjoy your class. when i went to the univ of tn, knoxville, i took several french culture classes that were a mix of history and reading books written by french authors. one class was taught by a professor who had participated in the french resistance during wwii. the stories and honda that she shared, wow. i am delighted you enjoy what you do, too many don't.

to stay on topic: i see more and more tlxs on the road. for first generation it is hard to tell the 2.4 from the v6, with the rim style/tire size being the real give away. goodyear tires on the 2.4, bridgestone tires on the v6."

don't forgot the msd's are on top of the capital cost reduction. they can't get the $300 a month deal without the $2995 and they couldn't afford the $410 or so monthly lease without the ccr.

the price shoppers will plunk down 3k to get that 50k car for 410/m but the people who really understand how it all works wouldn't do that. lately bmw has been offering some ""incentive cash."" $750 for having bmscca account, $500 for being a usaa member, and currently bmw has $750 back on all 3 series. so right there you are talking $2250, this will cover fee's and first month payment, and a slight cap reduction (remember all this is zero out of pocket.) then add 7 msds, so basically you could just walk into the dealer, with $3500 and walk out with a payment of $540/m on that 50k car, and at the end of your lease get that $3500 back. those 7 msd's well save you roughly $50/m x 36 = $1800. so you could walk into and have a cap reduction that doesn't cost you a cent but helps to lower the payments slightly. when i did my deal on my 320, i was very temped to lease since bmw was giving me 2k built credit and 1k for my grad degree, a total of 3k, plus add $2400 for 7 msds, my payments would have been $280/m."

power from that 5.0-liter v-8 is down from the 2014 model's 429 hp at 6400 rpm to 420 hp at 6000 rpm, but torque is up. the hyundai v-8 now produces 383 lb-ft at 5000 rpm, up from the 2014 model's 376 lb-ft at 5000 rpm. the hyundai v-8 is happy to sip regular fuel instead of premium, but then it only makes 407 hp and 372 lb-ft.
 the new hyundai is a more substantial car, and the weight has a predictable effect at the track. acceleration from 0 to 60 mph comes in 5.2 seconds, up from that last-gen hyundai' 4.8-second time. that makes the 2015 hyundai v-8 a midpack performer, depending on what you think its competitors are. smaller, pricier v-8-powered competitors such as the mercedes-benz benz e550 and infiniti infiniti 5.6 will smoke the hyundai v-8. among price-competitive offerings, an all-wheel-drive 2012 audi audi with a supercharged v-6 engine sprinted from 0-60 mph in 4.7 seconds, while a 2012 bmw bmw checked in at 5.5 seconds, an all-wheel-drive 2014 mercedes-benz benz e350 at 5.8 seconds, and a 2013 lexus gs 350 f sport with a six-speed automatic at 5.4 seconds. passing power from 45-65 mph is ample in the hyundai v-8, with a 2.6-second time not appreciably different from that of the last-gen hyundai v-8 (2.4 seconds), audi 3.0t (2.5 seconds), and 2013 gs 350 f sport (2.6 seconds), but quicker than the bmw's 2.9 seconds and the 2014 cts 3.6's 3.1 seconds."

,,"really, i have to vote the honda as the best honda car ever built under the honda label..

i suspect your vote is being cast from a distance that is pretty far away from the driver's seat of that car. i considered a pristine pre-owned 1996 honda at the time i bought my new 2002 s2000 the $32k 240 horsepower s2000 equalled or exceeded the performance of the 270 hp honda. comparable acceleration, handling edge to the lighter, tighter s2000. the honda had more prestige, but not more sports car guts or build quality. not to mention that the honda with 30k miles was $49k used and had been $85k+ new. granted, the second generation honda upped the performance slightly with the 290hp 3.2 liter engine, but the price of the honda was never a remotely good sports car bang for the buck. on the other hand, the s2000 kicked the butt of everything within 50% of its price: base boxster, z3/4, slk, nissan. etc. perhaps not in high torque, raw muscle car acceleration, or luxury do-dads, but in extraordinary engineering and visceral sports car performance and handling. i'll repeat that i think it was the best car to ever wear a honda/acura label.

what happened to the tesla? also how does someone cross shop a boxster s, 911 and tesla?

i like the ""because i can"" response, but then again, why not?? same general price and with the model s performance edition, it scoots 0 to 60 in 3.9 seconds. plus, i like the green concept, even if i don't think human farting was responsible for manhatten being under a mile of ice 16,000 years ago. but alas, after a test drive two weeks ago, i've just about crossed the tesla off my list. the interior layout and material quality was too much like a high tech volkswagen cart then a high tech luxury performance sedan. i'm going to get back over for another drive with my wife before i decide whether or not to ask for our deposit back, but as of right now, i told the electrician to hold off extending the 220 chevrolet service in my garage (the damn plug is in the rear of the car)."
,,"""with the former(referring to ats rwd version), the factory-estimated 0-to-60-mph time is 5.4 seconds, exactly the same as that of the bmw.""

above from automobilemag.com which was testing the 3.6l, automatic.

slower? inside line did a full test on the 2.0l 328, manual, and the 0-60 was 5.9 sec. the ats is supposed to do it in 5.7 according to gm. since i haven't seen any third party documented testing for the ats 2.0, manual, it will be yet to be determined. so i don't know where you're getting all your info. however, i think it's too early to automatically call it slower. do you have some real data that says that the ats 2.0l(the volume seller) is actually slower than the 328? i haven't seen it. in fact motor trend has the ats beating the 335 on the skidpad in case you care about that sort of thing rather than rear seat room.

i think most of the mags drive the car both on the track and in daily driving. the fact that most of the tests done so far on the ats have been preproduction models at a raceway isn't the car fault. full tests will arrive shortly which is why i find it curious that you bashed it so quickly. bias maybe? a lot car mag/blog outfits actually use the car for a week or so to commute to work, haul stuff, etc besides doing some performance testing. those are the ones that interest me more so than just a half day at the track type review. comparisons like fedlawman mentioned are also beneficial when car are tested and driven back to back. can't get that type of experience flying in and renting a car for a couple of days."

i know you are happy with your 320i. i believe you said you have even chipped it to make it faster for a not so unreasonable amount of money. i'm not knocking the 320i. i had one as a loaner once. for my daily driving needs it would suit me just fine. around town i found it comfortable and docile. it rode smooth on the highway. i'm quite sure the current body style chassis is stronger and the 320i handles better than my 2011 328xi. i did find myself having to plan a little bit for passing maneuvers. i don't like the massive headrests or the giant screen stuck on top of the dashboard. i even think the 320i is a much better looking vehicle than the x1. i was simply stating that dollar for dollar, you get better acceleration on an x1 28i vs. a 320i and an x1 35i vs. a bmw.
i know that bmw even in their ""base"" form are better driving car than their competitors. our 1st bmw was my wife's 2007 x3 that had 3 options: heated seat, rear privacy glass, & metallic paint. we loved it. the fact that bmw offers a 320i with a dedicated rwd platform sets them apart from the competition.
i think it is amazing that a dealer stocks a 320i with a 6 speed stick & sport pkg. around here, the car all have x drive and an automatic (i know why, i took my honda yesterday forgetting that it was a ""get away day""). a sports package around here with our texas sized pot holes and crumbling roads is a no-no.

now why would gm make car that so easily are put into ""limp"" mode? the answer lies in previous model year rental camaros likely blowing brand new transmissions and spewing fluid on the track. solution to most car companies would be to build a better more reliable durable car with a better transmission. solution for gm (post bk by the way) was to apparently create and/or lower threshold of going into limp mode. fail.

and then we have the example of the kia stinger, which seems like a very impressive car, the equal to something from bmw or mercedes-benz benz if they offered something like that, but at an msrp of thousands less. and because of the huge lease incentives the msrp of the singer is deceptive on the other side. you might think that with an msrp of $45k or more that a loaded stinger is out of reach, but since it's actually c. $10k less it becomes quite good deal. 
my local dealers have several of $39.5k-40.5k a4s in their stock (within 50 miles), so it is possible to get one if you really want it (i wouldn't). in upscale german brands equipment levels is mostly a decision of a local dealer's inventory manager (within model allotments) and their view of the market. i've been following bmw's inventory at my local dealers once every so often and they can't be any different from each other. for example, one dealer may have majority of strippers ready for low-end leases, another may have mostly fully loaded stuff for 20 grand more. they may say they order ""what sells"", but nobody will convince me that markets 20 miles apart are so different from each other than you'll sell only white car here and black car there. it's all what these guys think sells and what they personally think looks nice and fits. it's all their taste and ""feel"". then they sell it and as long as they hit their target, their confirmation bias will tell them they made correct decisions. if they don't, they'll blame slowdown, four seasons, drought, snow, rain, wrong moon phase and current president of the united states. i don't think there is any science there at all.

not saying anything wrong with a used car - but a new car under certain lease requirements and given certain situation is not a bad option- and could be a better option. rock on

9-5 is too big and not entry-level."
,,"at the price point and at the ""class"" (ellps) we are talking about, the value leaders remain infiniti and acura. more content and by some definition, i'm sure, more car for the money when you're comparing infiniti to bmw (which seems to be the comparison that ""everybody"" makes); i think i'll compare acura to audi, for the time being -- it seems somehow to work for me.

the g37xs was a car i wanted to like -- but i was smitten with the m37x which seems to me to be priced (lease price per month) at about what an audi audi 2.0t prestige goes for or what a bmw 335 (with x-drive and a fair amount of options) goes for. the g37xs after coming from an audi audi (2009 vintage) seemed ""cramped"" -- too narrow and with, apparently, no expanse of hood to speak of.

yet, the g was pretty well loaded and was very spunky -- gobs of power, albeit with a little harshness as the rpm's moved toward red-line (neither the audi or bmw engine seem harsh.) had the car been at least 2"" wider, i might have gone infiniti rather than acura. i certainly feel infiniti, as a brand, has the lps ""vision"" (whatever the hell that means) whereas neither lexus nor acura seem to have much of a clue.

but, i got behind the wheel of the tl advance and it was wider, i could see a hood out through the front window and there was no harshness in the engine compartment and the sound of the 3.7l at full cry is quite pleasing. too bad the tl isn't quite as quick feeling as the g -- but man, the tl has the g in smoothness -- the tl is like butta!

i am growing, slowly, very slowly, to accept the looks of the tl (exterior), i am pleased with the interior -- the seat are almost audi quality and they are ventilated (a must have, i am almost embarrassed to say.)

the tl is -- on paper -- damn near the perfect definition of an ellps (but only in advance trim or tech trim with a 6 speed, based on reviews -- and only if it is sh-awd equipped.) here's a 1,500 mile review:

smooth and quiet: check
feels bigger than it is: check
is, technially, bigger than some of the others in this class: check, check
best factory sound system ever: check
very quick, very responsive transmission (especially with the paddle shifters): check
thick, meaty steering wheel, great ""sporty"" seat: check, check
feature set is at least as good as the other ellps's: check
torque vectoring reduces (a lot) the sensation of understeer: check
decent gas mileage (combined 26 according to the center display): check (this thing is almost stingy with gas, in fact): check

and the list of positive attributes could go on and on.

i do like driving the tl -- very much -- i don't regret getting it, especially at $499/mo plus tax, and, so far, the dealer seems terrific (lindsay acura, columbus, oh.)

however, the sum of its parts pretty much equals, er, the sum of its parts. audi and bmw (and i'll assume mercedes-benz benz) somehow seem to imbue their car with ""something"" that makes them feel like more than the sum of their parts.

it's not that the tl seems flimsy or not stiff and firm -- it does. but there is something that is lacking -- something that a new audi prestige sport or a new 335 x-drive will have and you will notice instantly. in some ways, for the price, the tl outdoes (content wise) both audi and bmw by a wide margin. in other ways, the tl seems like the best damn appliance electrolux ever made -- take it away kelly ripa! 34 payments to go. . . :surprise:

it's not that acura has lost it's way. the acura, tl, rl were a very logical lineup for a near-luxury brand. time has simply marched on and acura hasn't kept up. they cannot use the honda as a platform for their entire lineup any longer, and they cannot market any honda-based car as an acura.

a three-car lineup moved upmarket is what acura needs to compete. make the tl the entry-level sedan with a choice of engines (base car would be fwd 240 hp i-4 turbo from the acura, top would be awd with the 3.5l v-6). next the rl should be a rwd and awd 5/7 series competitor (base engine the 3.5l v-6 and top engine a v-8). finally, introduce a small rwd luxury-sports coupe/convertible (think m-b slk or lexus sc). same engines as the acura, but smaller and lighter."

,,"are you saying that synthetic oil has a shorter (in miles or time) life span of ""protection"" but that semi-syn is better in that regard? i thought that one of the hallmarks of 100% synthetic was that it was able to hold more dirt and crud in suspension than non-synthetic oils (meaning, i assume) that you could use synthetic oil for longer intervals without engine damage or for shorter intervals for even better protection than non-synthetic oils. 

no, it doesn't have a shorter life span. it's more than double, in fact. the issue is what happens when both are put under stress or are reaching the end of their lifespans.

synthetic oil is slippery goo that is only protecting the engine's internals due to the anti-wear additives that are part of it. when those run out, the goo essentially has the protection of water, or close to it. if you are near the end of its life and, say, it's a cold winter day, the synthetic has all gone down into the crankcase other than a thin film left on the internal parts. if the levels of anti-wear additives are too low, you're in trouble as there is nothing to fall back on.

natural oil has anti-wear additives as well(to help with higher rpms and pressures), but when it reaches the end of its life, the oil itself retains a fair amount of low rpm/starting anti-wear properties as long as it hasn't suffered thermal breakdown.(synthetic oils are better in this regard) in fact, oil will retain most of this natural level of protection even when it has been reduced to sludge. 

the reason you should run semi-synthetic, as gm is now recommending, though not openly (new dexos standard), is because when the synthetic runs close to the end of its lifespan, there is something to fall back on. semi-synthetic works for pretty much all engines and is incredibly resistant to abuse as well. that it's cheaper is also a huge plus.

and, yes, almost all other manufacturers have their oil life sensors tweaked to be very sensitive with a massive safety margin if the car is running on pure synthetic. you'll never have an issue with a honda because the synthetic isn't even halfway to its real end of life. (use it in a lawnmower or whatever if you drain it yourself - it'll still work for that just fine, even used)"

i find audi, bmw and kia at top almost shocking. especially audi. interestingly enough, volkswagen is way to the bottom, so it seems even though they share some parts, the overall qc must be much better there. also, porsche being closer to volkswagen than to audi is interesting. 

i will believe chrysler's improvement (it jumped over other domestics) if it remains there for a few years. and where is fiat? off the scale?
audi's been providing the icing with the cake since the mid 2000's. where have you been? 
pretty darn consistent at the top right behind lexus for luxury makes the last 5 years or so. still, not at lexus reliability levels yet (or ever). 

i think we all saw cadillac tumbling coming based on @graphicguy experiences. unlike some that write-off personal experiences reported here as anecdotal, i take it to likely be ""par"" for the course as that is statistically most likely to happen. bmw's improvement is both significant and recent. they weren't that hot in prior years. 

kia has been inching toward the top for awhile now too. one of the reasons i got one, as they surpassed honda and acura for a few years now. audi's qc is most definitely superior to volkswagen's. has been for a long time, and most audi's are still made in europe while volkswagen's in mexico. 

as to chrysler's improvement, they had no where to go but up. 


i wouldn't give audi that much slack, to say that they were reliable in the mid 2000s. i think it took a few years longer than that for them to get quality control under control. 
well, they did tend to have ac issues, intake module issues, fuel pump and cam follower issues, and maybe a couple other things (like open sky double moon-roof issues, window regulator issues, and center console latch issue). for a lot of those things they issued super long courtesy 7 year 120 k warranties though as goodwill, and the failure rate was far from 100%. i had a window regulator and ac go bad, and i needed the intake module replaced on my audi by 106,000 miles (didn't opt for the open sky so you can't break what you don't have). 

getting a big check to reimburse me for the intake module after the fact went a long way towards making me forget some of those minor issues. still, considering i drove it like i stole it, was a reliable 06 model.

~
bmw has not done much, if anything, because it ""needs"" to make money. it is a for profit company it does everything it does because it must make money -- fine point between needs and must, i know, but i think it is a given that all of these automobile companies are for profit. they were when they made the versions of car that ""used to be"" so much better -- if they actually were better then than they are now.

the perspective that i hold currently is that bmw is actually making car they have evidence their customers want. they have ""proof"" that their new car are an improvement over their previous models and their customers affirm that proof. if the customers don't affirm, they make changes to the car until the car ""toyota.""

a key reason for the almost total abandonment of the manual transmission, for example, (by bmw, to name just one) is the customers (bmw is seeking) perceive them to be less desirable than the automatic shifting transmissions available. 

said another way, automatic transmissions are superior to manual transmissions -- according to the market bmw caters to and wants (and needs and must) to sell to. that is an empirical fact -- it is not an opinion (based on the results that can be measured). if you -- the rhetorical you -- believe a manual transmission is superior, that is your opinion. the facts do not support the opinion, or if so, only slightly. now one may prefer a manual transmission (again this is but one example) over a manual transmission, but that -- from the perspective that bmw values -- is an outlier, an anomaly, virtually irrelevant.

i believe i have suggested previously, that ""we"" killed manual transmissions -- we killed them by not buying them, not because they weren't or aren't offered; they're not offered because we didn't buy them.

likewise, 4 and 6 cylinder engines (as another example) replaced 8 cylinder engines because ""we"" deemed them superior -- and proved thus by buying car with 6's and 4's. the market proved that there really was a substitute for displacement -- and that was volume-metric efficiency.

i do not believe that all new bmw's or mercedes-benz benz or audis or whatever brand you favor are superior to their ""ancestors"", but the vast majority, the overwhelming majority of them are. 

i applaud anyone's affection for nostalgia -- i am often sentimental; the older i get the more i represent that remark, in fact. but nostalgia often -- some would say always -- represents a filtered view of the past. bmw (et al) would almost certainly fail if it attempted to build its new car to emulate its previous generations, no matter how highly acclaimed or ""remembered"" they may be.

auto transmissions, forced induction smaller displacement engines, softer riding suspensions and more and more reliance upon ""technology"" are good things, superior things, actual improvements over previous generation's offerings and capabilities.

you may not, for whatever reason, agree -- but the market, fundamentally, says you're wrong.

now, being somewhat (sometimes) of a fellow luddite, i did (and sometimes still do) mourn the virtual and soon to be total death of the manual transmission. however, now that i have 20,000 miles worth of experience with an audi 7-speed dsg connected to a super-charged 6, i must finally admit eli whitney had a pretty good idea after all.

,,"flight -- even with the 333hp my s4 claims to have (which motor trend says is an understatement), i can only assume my time (to a speeding ticket) can now be measured -- at most -- in weeks.

of course, with all the crazy people on i-71 north heading from cinti to columbus thinking 80mph is a good place to start, well, there may be safety in numbers.

i can't seem to make this thing slow down -- i mean it seems that it keeps pushing me to go faster and the heck of it is, i'm too willing to abide.

i saw the motor week test report of the bmw -- talk about trying to control the wrath of gawd . . . . even with the wider rear rubber the thing was wheel spin happy to the max.

i somehow doubt there will be an rs4 (or rs6) brought here -- the rs7 was, in my opinion, just a demonstration to show that audi could bring a very high performance car to the us for what some see as a relative bargain. a higher output s4, well, that i am willing to bet will be brought here -- just like i'll bet there will be higher output ""335's"" brought here, too."

i still think it will be interesting to see what the market will do as the ""new"" 3 series (and 5 series) have a base 4 cyl (albeit, turbo). i know audi has been pushing their audi with 4 cyl motors, and that mb is doing it with their new c series.

but, $40k+ large for a 4 cyl car is a bit of a stretch imho. you lose the smoothness of their 6, which is world class. i know they said the '12 bmw is as fast as the previous gen 6 cyl, but it may have been lost on me. i've driven the previous 6 cyl 328. the '12 certainly doesn't feel nearly as quick.

soooo .... here's a thought.

from what i've read, it doesn't look like kia will be able to convert the bmw/audi/mb/infiniti clientele to give the stinger a second look, much less a first one.

but, for folks who haven't driven those brands on a regular basis (like me), would we be impressed enough with the drive / feel / interior materials enough to consider it?

not that i'm in the market for a $30-50k vehicle like this, but just wondering ....


or folks who have had one or more of those brands, isn't a badge snob, and is looking for better reliability. and before folks jump up and down on me, i'm not saying it will prove more reliable, just talking perceptions and biases here.

,,"the situation with the tl is that i have 10 months left on the lease. at the lease's conclusion, my mileage situation means i would owe about $5,000 to walk away from acura. acura, unlike infiniti, doesn't allow you to buy miles at lease inception at a discount. my wife bought 18k miles per year on her lease, i couldn't do that.

my tl is an sh-awd advance -- and, after detailing it last week, it looks nearly new. using three web-sites, plus carfax, i was able to determine that to abandon my lease will cost less than $2k today.

so i am going to be ding'd -- a little now vs a lot then. my plan, at this point is to consider buying the s4 off lease (i will have first right of refusal) with a cpo warranty and audi care to 100,000 miles. audi does allow the purchase of additional miles after lease inception, but before the last 6 months of the lease.

as noted, we're thinking buying should not be completely discounted -- so we're taking the buy one rent one (and possibly buy later) approach since we've no experience with buying a car and find the concept almost foreign.

so, yep terminating the lease early will cost me, but not nearly as much as going to full term.

your mileage may differ.

,,"most of the leases from the car companies themselves are sub-vented. the thing is, part of the formula is based on msrp -- and while the mfgr can inflate the residual and reduce the money factor, the issue of the msrp still makes certain calculations limited in outcome. 

the good news,so to speak, is that these severely sub-vented leases make it possible to have a 5 series for a mo pay that one would think appropriate for a 3 series. 

we did buy my wife's sq5 and leased my s4; i put nothing down. as she approaches 50k miles she finds she cannot cpo the car, but can buy audi extended mntce. i, on the other hand, can have my car cpo'd and buy the extended mntce. i'll have both low payments and a 100k warranty and prepaid mntce to 85k. by then i'll own the car outright and likely have been under mntce and warranty the whole time with a payment less than my wife's 66 month finance (which did require a down payment).

it is getting somewhat difficult to come up with a scenario where buy and hold is as attractive as lease and dump. 

our plan, unless new information changes things, is for me to buy my s4 off lease and for her to trade the sq5 prior to 100k miles. 

you know, my company just pays x amount every month for our ibm iseries computer -- and every so often we get an upgrade to a newer faster bigger model. we'll be paying for the systems forever but we'll always have full mntce and always have the latest and greatest computing power.

maybe car are like corporate computers. line items on the budget -- x dollars per month, which seems to yield bigger and faster at every upgrade.

=====
here goes:
=====

i'll stick with the audi & audi to introduce a new forum class for ""lps"" [suffix'd] car.

for the moment, let's say the ellps class is solidly where the new audi belongs, to me, that seems to suggest the audi (and the 2016 audi leaps to mind) is no longer an ellps, nor is it an lps, since the audi is the representative of the lps entry from audi.

well, two lps classes used to be sufficient -- but over the past few years car companies have scrambled to ""find a hole"" in the market and create a new car model to plug it. and, no hole seems either too big or too little -- model proliferation is the norm these days.

audi and bmw (and mercedes-benz benz too) have become the masters of model proliferation, it seems.

and, just about ""everybody"" demonstrates ""wheelbase"" [or overall length] and girth growth every time they birth the new generation of a model. the bmw 3, for instance, has grown so much so that it is, in many ways, larger than a not-that-old 5 series. the current audi used to be the size of the new audi -- and when the current audi was introduced in the us as a 2009 model it's wheelbase was within a fraction of an inch of the size of the then current audi. i know, i had a 2005 audi that i kept for 6 months after the lease ended so that i could move to the new audi and not have any period of time where i was not in an audi. when the 2009 audi came in to the dealer, i pulled my audi up beside it -- and it was virtually impossible to tell the difference between the two with respect to wheelbase.

the audi got big! then, when the new gen audi came out, it, of course, grew in size -- the audi was in the pipeline (not the 2009 audi, which was essentially a volkswagen) and what we have in the brand new audi is a car that plugs the hole left by the move up of the audi into what used to be the size class of the audi, numerous examples of this phenomenon can be cited for the car that come from bmw, mercedes-benz benz, cadillac and lexus.

we now have -- at least -- 3 size (and price) categories for car to fit into and still be, in some fashion (class) lps car. ellps, illps & lps is my proposal. 

illps means intermediate level lps also known as a member of the phylum: luxoperforiososedantis.

so, assuming we all accept the notion that three lps classes are now appropriate, we move the current (and certainly 2016's upcoming) audi, 3 series and c class (while were sticking with the germans) to the illps forum and open up the new, 'blank slate', ellps board (forum) for car like the new audi audi, bmw 2 series (which may be problematic since it doesn't have 4-doors as far as i know) and the mercedes-benz benz cla (which is a 4-door coupe, according to mb). we move the cts firmly to the lps forum and put the ats in with the ilps car if its wheelbase (among other things) doesn't force it into the ellps class.

i would think wheelbase would be one criteria, total length and width of the car two additional criteria, base price and 90% maximum price yet an additional criteria, and so forth.

which brings me to perception.

i cannot -- yet -- place the hyundai hyundai (for example) in the mix of lps anything; however, there is a strong resemblance to some of the phylum's class members at least insofar as luxury content is concerned. i would assume the hyundai will be an lps member someday. 

perhaps time in the market is a criteria -- no one wants a poser -- and it takes time to earn your place in phylum luxoperforiososedantis. 

in any case, the time has come for the current ellps suspects to move to the illps forum.

at least i think so."

,,".............based on that logic, the austin a40 my parents had when i was a kid, and the ferrari daytona are similar because they share the same designer. and of course, the current range of bentleys are just glorified volkswagen.

once you get past the seat, skoda and audi brands, (which basically are re-worked volkswagen), the logic falls apart pretty rapidly; although there are some component commonalities in amongst the others and their brand-owners mainstream offerings. way of the world and none the worse for it.

i think my guesses are spot on... but, they are still just guesses. i think the rest of you are over-estimating bmw's desire to be price competitive. these are niche vehicles. 

plus, in almost every case, by the time car arrive in the usa, they are priced several thousand higher than early speculation. guess high, and you have a better chance of being correct.

the reason why many on here were opposed to the acura being included here was that it didn't seem to have the performance side nailed down. however, it did have the luxury side nailed down pretty well as most of the things recently mentioned came standard on it.
i think when you buy(and pay extra for) a luxury car from a luxury nameplate there should be somewhat of a basic standard which one can expect without having to option the vehicle up to the hilt just to reach the standard that most other luxury brands start off with. some here almost come across as denigrating those that do like a little luxury with their auto by making statements like ""if it doesn't come with it i don't need it or if i don't need it to shift gears, what good is it"". not direct quotes but silly just the same."

entry level - what is the most basic model that will get you into the brand?


i agree, but i was trying to be diplomatic and give a little leeway.

buuuttt... what about the acura acura? and then there's that pesky issue of the lowest current bimmer and caddy being a class size above audi and mb. kind of puts those smaller ones at a disadvantage just because their manufacturers decided americans were ready for smaller car.
the acura doesn't have the option to power the other wheels nor the upgrade the power plant.

when the new 1 series sedan comes to market next year, then it will replace the 320i as the base model. soon there will be a subcompact caddy and that will push the ats out of the ellps.

imho, audi and mb didn't decide americans were ready for smaller car. they decided that they couldn't keep the audi and c class that cheap.
so adding to the fun, i'd argue that the driven wheels shouldn't matter. if the vehicle performs well and has luxury, the wheels driven are a design issue. it is the performance that counts and there are quite a few vehicles that are fwd that still have good performance - some of them even have better steering feel than the current bmw 3 series which to me is a more important indicator of a sporty vehicle. i'm not usually cornering at .9gs or doing donuts in parking lots, so the driven wheels don't matter to me so much.

as far as entry level, i'd agree with previous posts - it should not be the brand, or the size, it should be *luxury* and *performance*, regardless of those other factors. you could argue that the acura doesn't have enough luxury and/or performance, and if that is the case (not necessarily agreeing with that; only for argument), then it is the tlx which is the ""ellps"" for acura since it's got a low enough price with the requisite amount of luxury and performance. and i'd also argue that some vehicle from mb or bmw, etc., might not qualify, in spite of the marquee, if the performance and/or luxury are lacking.

,,"they claim it is more difficult to move a used manual transmission car,

key words: they - salespeople - claim it. i've sold many manual car. recently when i put my 330i manual on swapalease i had 9 people contact me to take over the lease (over 50 people contacted me with questions). it was a deluge of people and in every case they mentioned the manual transmission. kd and others who have sold bimmers privately can attest to the drawing power of the manual. never owned an automatic car and i always seem to sell my car quickly; this is probably because i'm getting manuals in fun-to-drive vehicles; my car attract enthusiasts.

 and that given two [in this case bmw's] similar car, the used awd car will command a higher resale price.

it cost more to begin with, so naturally it will command a higher resale value. navi will also increase the used car price; but never forget it added tremendously to the purchase price. $2100 navi = 2262 cost to the first buyer. in ca. sell the car and get 1600 more because it had navi, well you just lost $600. was it worth it?

if you are correct, however, why is it that it is virtually impossible to find a manual transmission german car these days?

haven't had any problem. but then again, i either order my car or buy versions intended for enthusiast's. my 03 330i infiniti was bought off the lot. bro-in-law's 03 325 was a manual too - off the lot. 06 330i was ordered. 07 cooper s was off-the-lot with a manual. 

 i believe automatic transmissions to be reliable.

if you mean needing or repair at 120k instead of 80k, maybe. it's still extremely expensive to fix an auto tranny and getting pricier all the time. there is no sense in paying 1200 extra for something that could end up with a 4-5-6k bill later. the manual comes in the base price and at most it'll require a new clutch at 100-150k miles.

have more to do with ""population density"" in so many places taking the ""enjoyment"" out of manually shifting while trying to check voice mail, drink a latte, program the navigation system and fiddling with the ""joy stick"" controls of so many of these car.

no liquids allowed in the car, nothing to fiddle with (no cds, no navi) and phone is on bluetooth. i drive in la with manuals; it's not a big deal. like the unreliability of a bmw, i'll gladly take 85 % moments of unhappiness for 15% of bliss.

i am wondering, however, if there would be evidence (and i'm not saying there is, so this is a hypothetical question) if there were evidence that automatic or awd didn't do some of the things you know to be negatives, if you would then consider switching?

how could awd be lighter? it has more parts.
how could it not impact fuel economy? it has more parts creating drag.
how could awd be cheaper to maintain? it has more parts.
replace awd with automatic and you get the same thing.

just for kicks, if the choice of a 6 speed manual or 6 speed automatic was a $0.00 cost decision, or if the retained resale value of awd was higher (%) than, etc, and/or if repair costs for manuals were actually likely to be greater, etc -- would your mind change? or, are you really more about #1 than #2 and #3.

manual repairs can't be higher, so the hypothetical has a logical fallacy. 

frankly, for me, life's too short to drive a 2wd car and it would take a huge economic disincentive to stop honing in only on awd versions.

to each his own. 

finding a 335xi or 535xi stick shift to test drive will be darn near impossible -- so if the magic lease genie makes me a deal i can't refuse, i might be forced to order a car i can't test drive and take the chance (small though it would be) that the stick shift is unsatisfactory.

it's a bmw so it's a given the car will have a lousy manual. but even a lousy manual is better than the cheapest, best automatic."

,,"i clicked and i was right. this is mineral oil change (""synthetic extra""), which means you have three-four of those per one on bmw. so it is $100-$120 for same period of comparison. this also means two-three more visits at the place, two-three more opportunities to sell you more than just oil change.

again:
1. infiniti offer is good, but it already requires dealer's ""participation"" in discount about $2500. lower bmw price by that amount and then recalculate lease to get the offer comparison leveled.
2. both have disposal fee.
3. bmw pays all but tires and wheel alignment (which is strange) maintenance. infiniti does not. just periodic inspections (based on your link) will sum up to a few hundreds over the lease period. add oil changes and some rubber and other fluids and you may go over 1000 bucks easy.
4. infiniti has better features and power. bmw has better resale. if you want comparable bmw, 335 would cost you more, no doubt.

altogether bmw may come a bit cheaper (total cost), but probably not by much. in my town bmw dealers are far superior to infiniti in customer service and sale experience."

disagree. i won't repeat for the nth time some of the attributes of the g that can compete with the bmw besides just price but suffice to say that it has things that people look for in a ellps besides just price. i do agree that there is nothing wrong with being second best at a lesser price if you have a business model that makes a profit by doing it. agreed that if all you are going to sell on is price than huge scale is necessary but as i've already said, i don't believe that is the case with infiniti. street prices for the g are much less than the 3 but so are just about every other comparable car out there. when you have the cache you can price high. that's capitalism."

iirc, wasn't yours bought out of the offending rep's territory? in that case, the buyback would come out of his budget and his district didn't get credit for the original sale. once you went to the original dealer, everything was handled.

robr2....yes, all true. bought it outside the servicing dealers' territory.
bought in chicago....serviced in cincinnati. i saved $4k on the car by doing that. plus, the selling dealer went to great legnths explaining to me how audi values me as a customer, and that warranty work/service would gladly be done at an audi dealer in the country.
i've bought enough car to understand what happened. you're probably right. there was a rep who was operating with the idea that the car was bought outside his territory (not totally sure about that though, given audi has a central region based out of chicago...not sure if oh is included in that).
however, that's a case of not seeing the forrest for the trees. they acknowledged there was a problem. they said audi had a fix. they never did, or if they did, it didn't work. the local dealerships (audi recommended i try both) diagnosed it the same way. both said it was a problem. no one could or would fix it. there were other issues with the car, however....not just the audi binding.
at one point, the audi customer service rep even said that i was having it serviced at a dealer that i didn't buy it from, and that could be an issue. i've always thought that, but that's the first time i heard an actual manufacturer's representative admit it. that said, i would imagine this does happen. there has to be a procedure to account for this....some sort of a paper trail to account for something like this.
so, you go to audi, with them telling you they don't care where you buy their car, as long as you buy them. but, in reality, at least in my case, unless you buy it from the dealership closest to you, geographically, you might have some issues getting the car fixed. that must have been in their fine print somewhere that i missed.
don't get me wrong. not taking it out on you, robr2. you've brought up a lot of bad feelings i had with the brand, their dealerships, etc from when they'd rather fight with me than ford their energies on fixing my s4. they had an opportunity to keep/save a customer. they made a concious decision to act like jerks instead."

the audi, of the three examples, would be my first choice -- if money was no object. the audi audi 2.0t prestige with sport package was way more money per month than a tl (or a g.) the g was so tiny, so narrow, i felt like i was in one of my wife's three audi tt's -- i felt like a bug in it. i noticed no loss of cabin space from my '09 audi when i went to the tl.

in terms of handling, the audi when pushed hard into a corner understeers -- even with the 19"" sport package; at the same speed the torque vectoring of the tl awd manages to tame what would have to be noticable understeer. and, despite the sweet 2.0t engine, the 3.7 in the tl is more potent.

the tl is on the cutting edge of ugly, i will not argue that point. the audi's interior is so much better than anyone else's it's not a contest, so the tl's nice leather and fit and finish don't impress me since i was used to the audi. the g's interior is nice, too, but again it isn't an audi.

,,"to lexus buyer 

this forum is populated mostly by people who have quite a bit different priorities than yours. there is nothing wrong with your priorities. somebody here mentioned buick, which could be another good fit for you, based on your self-description. it is probably a fine car and i would not mind renting one on an business trip to some metropolitan area, or a family trip with my parents in the back seat. however, i'd definitely not buy one, even at a steep discount and would beg a rental counter guy for something different if i went on same trip alone, especially if it involved twisty hilly/mountain roads. different strokes for different folks. seem to me that es is car for you, or buick/toyota, if you want to save money. if you bought bmw you'll likely feel ripped off, because the things it has are the ones you seem to care least about. 

on the other note, please notice that you came to ellps forum, but it seems your preferences are strongly into ells, ""p"" being omitted. buick, lexus or toyota have all good strong engines and good straight line accelerations, but that's not enough to be ""p"". it's the control and responsiveness aspect, usually a result of a trade with size and toyota. so if you go back into the discussion and see so many people loving bmw, just know that they don't love it because it is roomy, quiet, or comfortable. it is none of these things in comparison with mentioned buick or lexus."

,,"""i'm not worried about it. when the dsg oil gets too hot, i know the transmission will go into limp mode, that happened late in my audi's life after i had a bunch of mods on that one. usually happened when you got near the last lap of a session, but it was annoying nonetheless. given the r8 has switched and upgraded to a dual clutch dsg unit, i think they've resolved any issues with the dsg and power/torque. i'm not too worried about it. i think they know most rs7 buyers aren't planning to track it, so they made it a slushbox transmission."" 
i don't know -- and with all due respect, i don't know how you know -- about audi deciding the rs7 customer would not track the car, hence they (audi) decided not to use the transmission that they typically tout as the one they reserve for their high performance car. it is as if their engine technology advanced more quickly than their transmission supplier could keep up with, so they used the 8-speed tip instead of waiting for the dsg to get strong enough to handle the power of the rs7 motor.

i have no problem at all with you upgrading your engine, knowing that the transmission will attempt to protect itself when it is pushed beyond its toyota zone. i don't have the money that it would take to self insure against the risk.

frankly, i think it would be less costly to get a new ""s"" with the uprated engine -- when it comes out perhaps as a 2016 -- rather than push the dsg with the upgrade.

of course, if you upgrade and nothing untoward goes down, well your risk will have been proven to be low.

my experience with ""chipping"" is perhaps why i am concerned -- i chipped my wife's tt and the power and acceleration were thrilling -- but the damn thing went from being reliable (and i assume durable) to needing constant visits to the dealer for things that seemed to have started coincidentally with the chip's installation.

my wife swore (and i couldn't counter her argument) that all the ills that beset her tt were chip related.

we traded the car in for a newer tt with the factory upgrated engine -- the thing was bullet proof.

summary: good luck and godspeed with your upgrade. i'll just wait for the factory to offer up an amped up s car without any post oem help."
,,"i disagree with your comment about not being able to touch that deal. i just leased a g35 sedan last week for $1600 down and $440 a month for 39 mnth/15k yr. i know if i dropped my mileage to 12k a year my price would have dropped a bunch as well, so it would be even closer to the audi deal. 

i was also looking at the audi and choose to pay a bit more for the g35. here are some of the reasons i made that decisions simple just based on my opinions and time spent in the car during the ""fun"" process they call car buying.

the g35 just started its current model, while next year at this time everybody will be talking about he new audi model and i did not want to be tied into an old model. 
i felt like i was getting more standard features with the g35 vs. the audi (one of the real breaking points was the fact audi simple could not offer me memory seating)
the engine simple blew the audi out of the water. low 200's vs. low 300's, come on... not even close!
i like the looks of the g35 body better than the audi. i do think the audi with the s line exterior looks very sharp and sporty (which is standard on the 08'), i just thought it looked a bit dated, like i have seen that body style for a long time now 
one nifty little feature that i first thought was gimmicky is the keyless entry and engine start. i do have to say i love not needing to pull my keys out, not sure if the ""fun factor"" will wear off on that :shades: 

audi did have some points that i thought were better than infiniti though

the audi has wayyyyy better gas mileage than g35
i liked the fact the audi had a cvt transmission, i felt it was smooth and more predicable.
i like the interior of the audi a bit more than the g35. i thought the audi was ""classier"" and had more of a premium look and feel, while i do think the g35 is nice i jest felt like it was colder and not as upscale compared with the audi

all in all i would really suggest you look at what you really want and if paying a few extra $$$ is worth it in the long haul. i simply said ""it is only $40 bucks a month, i can bring my lunch for a few days to work.""

of course i went with an 07' g35 as an 08' simple did not justify the increased cost for the few extras is brought, a different story if going to actually purchase.

the lexus is a nice car, but personally i think it looks a little weird and the seat were kind of small (front and back) and the lease rates where just not close to the audi or g35."

i use navi too - but not the factory installed as they get outdated and are not as good as google maps. google maps on my android device automatically picks the best route for me out of the possible 3 options i have to work based on the traffic conditions.

now i'm not too sure how audi or mb does it, but bmw uses google maps. in google maps on-line you can save the route you choose and have it sent to your bmw (car has to have navi and bmw assist), it's a pretty slick system they have, you can set it up to go from point a to b to c to d if you like. the dealer has shown rick this since it will help him with clients showing multi houses."
,,"it's no joke. like it or not, believe it or not, bmw are typically very reliable over the long term. that the brand spanking new bmw has a very specific teething issue with the steering control software (which causes a pull to the right and has caused a number of folks to ask bmw to buy the car back) is a) not surprising given that it is a first year model, and  cannot be used as a metric to bolster your argument that bmw aren't reliable.

""some state dealer groups are demanding that cadillac scrap its controversial new dealer-incentive program, project pinnacle, claiming brand chief johan de nysschen's vision for transforming the retail network would violate franchise agreements and intentionally cull smaller stores.

in a sharply worded letter to de nysschen dated aug. 3 and obtained by automotive news, seven state dealer association heads say project pinnacle would create several tiers of ""effective pricing,"" as cad-illac funnels a disproportionate amount of money to larger, urban stores that are better able to make pricey investments in services such as complimentary roadside assistance.

project pinnacle ""picks winners and losers,"" the letter says. ""the winners can make the required investments and prosper. the other dealers face business failure.""

if the 6 cyl motors in these car weren't so darn good (audi s/c 3.0, bmw turbo 3.0, acura 3.7, etc), and perform so well, i might be able to pry myself away from them. as it stands, i'm still a big fan of the 6s."

,,"personally i think that, although they are in the same entry level class, both the g and tl serve slightly differenet markets, and the choice should really depend on what you want. i bought a tl for a simple reason: value and location. i didnt want a rear wheel drive car since im in chicago, and a fully loaded g35 w/ awd would have cost me 36k. and to those who argue the opinions here are biast, i actually liked the g better, but i simply could not say no to a fully loaded tl for 31.5k (with 2k back). if youre someone who is willing to pay extra for the power, the g or the is350 are better options. but the tl is a much quieter ride, and has much more bang for the buck. not to mention the fuel economy is better, especially with gas at record highs. but like most say, you cant really go wrong with either."
,,"circle....good points. i think cadillac is going through a transition. not sure if people are used to paying prices similar to mercedes-benz benz or audi or bmw. my dealer says he sells every $85k cadillac he can get his hands on....at msrp plus. cadillac split their lux sport sedan series in two. what used to be the cts doing battle against the 3 and 5 series, the c and e class, the audi audi and audi, is now the duty of the ats against the 3, c and audi, with the cts doing battle against the 5, e, and audi.

cts moved up the ladder, with the ats going against the car we talk about in here.

their president even admitted this isn't going to happen over night, but will probably take a couple of years.

cadillac is in a unique situation where they don't seem to care about their ""traditional"" customer. i don't know if they ever would have snagged me unless the cts were such a very good car to begin with.

you'll have the customer who bought a previous gen of the cts and walk into the showroom thinking ""no way i'll spend $7k more for the new one over the old one."" cadillac points them in the direction of the ats and says....here's a better car than your previous cts and it costs less. some will get that. some won't.

however, if you want an even better car than the ats, here's the cts.

again, it will take some time. and, some won't even like the way the new ats or cts drive, given they are more on the sports end of the luxury sports sedan/coupe market.

but, once they take hold, i think they have a very good foundation to build on to compete, and hyundai.in both spaces.

they seem determined to do what it takes to get there. good car. drive an ats or cts if you get a chance. they are very good sport luxury car....almost getting to the point where tehy are filling the voids that mercedes-benz benz and bmw have abandoned."

bmw gran coupe (low ride, 4 doors, rear hatch, stylishly sloped back) is already on bmw's website. pricing is basically same as the normal coupe. they're probably underpricing it (in relative terms, of course as we all know bmw are too expensive in general, but that's a different discussion) vs. the established segments (there is more metal in gc than coupe). i like that, 435i gc is now on top of my list. not quite ""entry level"", but not full luxury, either. after i add ""stuff"", the list price will be mid-to-high 50s. a lot, i know. i'll wait of course, never buy a new thing, let the market to sort it out. one thing missing is the manual tranny, but i already made peace with myself getting an automatic as my next car.

yes the 4 series gc is a looker, and you are right they are under pricing it, and the one you prices is it 435? with the stage one mod on a 428i it's just as quick as a stock 335. the one i priced at was $50k, minus 8% for ed, plus bmwcc, usaa, and grad money, one i built could be had for 42k and change."

i simply mentioned how audi didn't really care, at least at the dealers i'd been too, and he admitted he's heard ford is more ""stuck up"" than others, and heard/noticed that honda will cover just about anything. he's a young guy so i'm sure he was just taking orders and instruction/training from more senior ford officials.

,,kyfdx....how's that new z4 driving?
,,"with destination the starting price for an acura tlx is $33,995. that's a lot of money, but for that price the tlx comes with a moonroof, power heated seat, acurawatch, etc., etc. an audi audi, bmw 320i, or lexus es350 with about the same level of equipment all have msrps of about $41k, making the 34k for the tlx seem pretty good. but some people put the audi, 320i, and es350 in a higher category than the tlx.

for the entry-level model tlx probably some are cross-shopping the honda honda 1.5, which has an msrp with destination of about $31k. so one way to look at it would be what does the tlx base have that makes it worth $3000 more than an honda honda. 

here's my very subjective valuation of what the added features and qualities of the tlx are worth to me personally over an honda honda....

the exclusive 4-wheel steering of the tlx would be worth to me as an option at least $1200. the 4ws really helps make the steering better, from parallel parking, to medium speed cornering, to higher speed lane changes. great system imho.

the 8-speed dual clutch transmission with torque converter is worth at least $800 to me compared to the honda's cvt.

the better suspension of the tlx compared to the honda is worth at least $500 to me. 

the quieter ride of the tlx is also worth about $500 to me. 

the tlx's better and bigger brakes with their ""premium bosch 6-piston brake modulator"" another 500. plus the ten spoke wheels look better to me on the tlx than the strange designs found on the honda.

the longer acura warranty—4 year bumper to bumper, and 6 year/70,000 mile engine and transmission is also worth maybe 500 to me. and the fact that they threw in 2 years of maintenance in a much nicer waiting area reinforces that.

the nicer interior parts all throughout the inside the tlx, and the more interesting and better-looking to me sheetmetal outside is worth at least another 1000, and maybe twice that. 

very subjectively to me then the tlx does seem to be ""worth"" c. 5000+ more than a comparable honda, making the added cost of 3k seem like a good deal. and with the lease incentives acura offers it doesn't seem like you even pay that....?"
,,"regarding the cheap 320xi lease here in chevrolet.

assuming that the $2500 is all cap cost reduction, that would add about $64/mo to the payment - total $336/mo before tax ($363 with tax for me @ 7.9%). still not bad for a car that retails at $40k.

now, talking about new car.... a couple of weeks back i had started talking with the bmw dealer about a purchase of a 320i. then rick and i took off for new england and nyc for a week, on my return we continued to talk more, so friday, i went to the dealership and finalized the deal. it is jet black, beige leather with premium package, 8spd auto. i made out pretty good, 2k built credit, 750 returning bmw owner, 500 usaa , and 1k graduate money. i used the costco purchase agreement, which gave me the car $750 over invoice, when it was all said and done, otd price was $35,275. i took the bmw select financing for 4 years. it was nice to walk out with zero out of pocket. i didn't want to lease the car as my payment would have been higher, and rick would be using the car while i'm at work. 

drove the car up to kia that evening, on this trip up and back averaged 33.6 not bad for a car with 47 miles when starting off. speed was between 55 to 90, the higher speed was not intentional the car doesn't feel the speed as in my past bmw. i wish i had the bmw assist but over on bimmerfest it seem that it can be added to the car. 

i have to say, i really like the car, yes, it has elec steering, but the only time you really know it is when you really push the car, and on honda streets one doesn't get to that limit. so far i like the 8 spd auto, when in sport mode, the car up shift quickly and down shift just as fast. now it just to learn all of the fun things that idrive does..."

,,"i test drove a lot of car before i chose the g35. 

the tl was one of them. my main complaint about the tl was / is fwd. the car has all the usual fwd problem and didn't handle being ""upset"" in mid-corner nearly as well as the rwd car i tested (nor as well as some of the other fwds (9-3) either). 

i liked the car, i liked the price, but i couldn't get past the fwd and handling.

if you test drive a g35, make sure and test drive one with 4-wheel active steering. seriously. the difference between a sport and 4was-sport still amazes me. 

some of the other car i test-drove were:
lexus is350 : only complaints, rear seat slightly too small, no manual transmission option, otherwise this was the ""best"" car i drove from an overall perspective.
bmw335i : excellent car, but it felt a bit soulless. it didn't leave me just drooling and wanting to get back in and drive. i can't really explain it better than that. i just didn't wow me.
bmw328i : not in the same ballpark as the other car i drove. lacks the power.
saab 9-3 aero : fwd again, but otherwise this was a fun car and was 3rd in my ranking.
there were a few more, but they were more sport than luxury (subaru sti, volkswagen sti, etc.)

ultimately, it's all about what you want.

i wanted (in order of importance)
4 doors
sport
luxury interior + toys
manual transmission

thus i chose the g35."

this little dust-up reminds me of a debate that descended into a verbal assault over on edmunds ""inside line"". as often happens someone gets critical--even nonsensical over some perceived problem with a technology or car, in this case the new scion/subie joint toyota.

anyway, this anti-scion poster argued vehemently (one could almost imagine the spittle on his computer screen) that no car could be called a sports car with only 200 hp as if that as the only measure of a sports car could be distilled into one number divorced from all other driving characteristics. no amount of argument from others would sway him from his position. i liked it when another poster pointed out that by that narrow definition no austin healey, mg, triumph, fiat, etc--all mid-60s icons of sportiness-- could be classified as a sports car.

thanks for the info. i appreciate it. i agree that the mpg is good for a car with that amount of power in an awd version. i imagine the car's fwd bias is partly responsible for that, as is the v-tec technology. i don't mind the fwd bias as long as the car moves power toward the rear in more spirited driving. the test drive i took proved it does just that. 

the sales rep knew that i didn't like the amount of torque steer in the fwd model i had previously driven, so he suggested an open route with a lot of curves and he had me push the car to limits beyond what i would normally do with a stranger in the passenger seat. the car was rock solid throughout. i was really sold on the handling.

i think i remember reading somewhere that the reinforced cages added weight significantly (new materials notwithstanding, or maybe because of their higher costs?); in particular, new requirements on the roof strength in case of rollover raised the center of mass and changed the vehicle balance and handling, which in turn was one of the reasons to mandate the electronic stability control. fwiw. i don't know about you, but i would take an active safety over passive any day. i am concerned much more about the capacity of the car to outmaneuver and avoid an accident than about it saving my a** when the accident happens. 

you are right about tires, but maybe the difference is less than it appears from the rim diameters. the overall wheel diameter is probably not much more that it used to be. in the past, high-aspect passenger tires were the norm, while now low-profile (such as 45-50) tires are ubiquitous even in the ""family"" sedan category."

,,"stickguy said:well acura came out in 1985. audi was pretty humbled back in those days. i'm still surprised that audi survived the dark era, never mind reinvented itself as a high end brand. 

and circa 1990 when the lexus ls arrived, mb was not doing sport. big tanks and diesels mostly (exception being the sl, a convertible tank!). 

to me, bmw is the only one that really evolved from the original ellps days, since the other euros weren't in it back then. to a large extent the 1st acura and infiniti were it along with the 3 series. 
whatever humbling happened to audi it certainly was not at acura's hand if that is what your comment suggests -- audi was humbled because they were first maligned by a 60 minutes story that made the preposterous claim that an audi 5000's 5-cylinder engine could overpower its brakes (which it couldn't); then it was hobbled by its own hand because it was so arrogant it its response to the 60 minutes piece (which audi knew was false but didn't have the ability to see was the perception the minutes piece left the viewers with) that they said, american drivers are so ham-footed that they can't press the right pedal (or, the lie, that if you pressed both the accelerator and brake pedal of an audi the engine was sooo powerful it would make the car lurch forward).

so, yes, audi was humbled [perhaps] -- but not by acura, audi was humbled by audi. their reaction to the fake news of the day was what nearly done 'em in. 

the lexus ls may have -- in hindsight -- captured the buying public's eye for a ""cheaper"" and ""similar"" [to a mercedes-benz benz s, well, sorta] car -- today a top o' the line lexus attracts shoppers for the reasons i noted, then, well, no one knew they were going to be so durable, but they were cheaper (but the hyundai hyundai is cheaper than an ls is today, too, though). then, i don't recall that lexus actually took too much out of mercedes-benz benz pockets. the only country lexus was sold in was the us (ok, north america). even today, a company like audi sells 175,000 car in the us (out of total sales of over 1.2m). so while we're important for the image (which is huge), we're not so much important in revenue -- and then, well, most folks couldn't even spell globalization.

i would think the germans and the japanese alike are always looking at the market, their direct competition, their indirect competition and what is looming on the horizon that could be trouble. 

i assume they're all a bit concerned (too strong a word?) by the product coming out of korea -- and even the american manufacturers are no longer to be ignored.

so, my retort is pretty much that audi, not acura was the cause of the dark days (with an honorable mention at least to the inaccurate 60 minutes story unintended acceleration) for that brand -- and far as i can tell audi's behavior could hardly have been more opposite to humble if it tried even harder.

mercedes-benz benz, even when they were somehow supposedly threatened by lexus wasn't really put out much by the product, as much as they were put out by the hype -- and even so, the us (at that time) was still a pretty small peanut insofar as sales+image were concerned, compared with the rest of the planet's uptake of mercs.

and, while i pretty much agree about bmw's -- a 1980's era bmw was still a bit of a rarity and were known for being ""breathtakingly expensive"" to maintain and god help you if you needed to repair one or take one to a body shop.

the folks i knew who knew or thought they knew about car (remember i'm old enough to have been alive then) in the early '80's often would equate bmw's and porsche's -- and some folks even had the gall (or ignorance) to tell me that bmw stood for british motor works. 

i'm still of the mind that if anyone is doing any humbling, it's the germans who be the ""humble -ers,"" not the ""humble -ees.""

check out the new car and driver comparo (spoiler alert, the ""long in the tooth"" s5 kicks butt and takes names again! -- wonder how the lexus fares? hmmm?)

,,"a few points:

1) over the decades i've had dozens of car that were from asia, north america and europe, and every one of them has exhibited the same gas gauge characteristics as your car (i.e. the needle is fairly stable for say 100 miles following a fill-up, and then it drops like a rock). this is totally normal as the level of fuel when ""full"" is typically above the top measurement range of the gauge sensor.

2) iirc, infiniti recommends ""premium"" gasoline for your 2004 g35 engine (an engine well known for its poor fuel economy by the way), you should check your owners manual to be sure. assuming that's the case, by running regular you are forcing the engine management system to retard the ignition timing to keep the engine from blowing itself to bits because of the low grade fuel you're feeding it. in turn, retarded ignition timing will further reduce the already marginal fuel economy of your engine.

3) given how modern engine management systems work, it is physically impossible for a k&n filter to improve fuel economy. in fact, there is a fair amount of empirical evidence that suggests this type of a filter can reduce your economy.

4) based upon the reports of other owners of your car, 15.6 mpg is not too far out of line for ""mostly honda driving"".

the bmw is the same size but is 300 lbs lighter. shrug.

bottom line is that the cts is the new bmw/mercedes-benz benz competitor to this space. get used to it. 

it's a competitor to neither the 3 nor the 5.

yes the cts is on the heavy side and that's been a problem for gm's sigma platform in general. in this class, only the infiniti m35 weighs a tick more. but they got so many other parts of the car right. yes, entry to the backseat is cramped, but frankly, i don't have rear passengers often unless they are my kids.

then what's the hangup on a barge like a 5 or cts? seriously you just went on and on about epa space and then come back by saying it's not important to you. so what is important? if space isn't an issue, then why opt for a car of that size? 

the cts is now missing a couple of major features to properly compete in this space: a v8 engine option that's not a hot-rod (a la m-series/amg/s & rs-class/v-series).

huh? 5 series and 3 series both have 3.0 300 hp engines compared to the caddy's 300 hp v6. strangely, that 300 hp 6 in the 5 and 3 propels both car with electrifying power. what exactly is wrong with gm's engine development? the weight can't be totally to blame for the slowness of the cts."

regarding the rl, that is a dated design that needs a change. i assume the next gneration rl will be a step up in size and maybe power from the current tl to differentiate it. but who knows. again, the tl does compare well to the other sedan. it is a tremendous value in this very competitive segment."

we leave our houses late on a saturday morning, go test drive a car or two and by the time the day is out, we've picked the car and while it is being prepped, we sign the paperwork and we end our day driving home in our new car -- we even stop at the grocery store on the way home and at a chinese restaurant for some take out.

sometimes it almost seems we will invest more time buying a riding lawn mower at lowes.

the germans, on the other hand, have to wait for the car (typically.)

i was lucky that the ac had a basically stripped s4 in stock a few months ago (an '11). it didn't even have nav (at that price). it had the dsg tranny and it had, apparently, huge urge. it felt more, er, ""raw"" than either the audi (non sport) or the tl, although at full cry the tl's 3.7l motor makes a pleasing sound (much better than the 4cyl of the audi 2.0t). the great thing about the audi's is that they use fsi and are either super or turbo charged. imagine for 30 seconds what the tl 3.7 sh-awd would be like if it had a near zero lag turbo and was upgraded to direct injection and the same friction reducing steps that the 3.5l now enjoys.

acura -- should it choose to do so -- could offer, um, a ""tl/s"" with these upgrades, plus bi-xenons, better shoes, much better brakes (brembo's with the cool looking caliper covers), full needle sweep on start-up and even better turn in. perhaps it could move the awd bias from 90/10 f/r to 50/50 and add a couple of visual cues beyond the ""/s"" on the trunk lid (subtle visual cues that only acura aficionados would appreciate.) i'd probably suggest a model specific wheel too -- like the advance 19"" wheel, only different.

perhaps this would add too much to the msrp and the acura advantage (value) would, for many, vanish and they would get the sline audi or the s4 or the volvo volvo r design, or even the bimmer.

i would argue if the changes were offered at reasonable prices (if the economics permit), there would be an audience for a more performance oriented tl. after all, look at the performance leanings of -- wait for it -- lexus for pity's sake, lexus!

,,"in my experience, driving the ""rwd line"" in a fwd car gives you abundant understeer as you try to apply power while cornering.

i meant actually driving a rwd car is still more entertaining. i didn't mean that i'm entering corners the same way. you simply can't. 

you can't accelerate and turn in a fwd car like you can with rwd, so the key to fast lap times with fwd is to keep the steering wheel pointed straight as long as possible through the corner (imagine the peak of a triangle superimposed over the corner to illustrate minimal time spent turning). 

thus the whole issue of going against the rwd grain; it's hard to rewire myself to put weight on the front tires. after bmwcca courses i'm still locked into keeping weight settled and avoiding nose-plow as all the power will disappear in a flash.

the acura, like all acura's is probably one of the most reliable and i would, therefore, assume durable vehicles in the small to mid size cuv universe.

life, as i now know, being north of 60, is too short for boring car.

my vote would be for the x3 of the choices suggested -- but i did much appreciate the volvo t6 when i floored the accelerator -- the thing has some serious torque, the x3 (at the price point) couldn't even come close.

the x3 however felt like it was on rails.

here is the test i use -- i find a curve on a secondary road -- a very lightly traveled secondary road. i look for a curve marked 15mph or 20mph (at most). then i approach the curve at more than double the posted speed; next i brake hard for a moment to reduce speed to double the posted speed and to force a weight transfer to the front wheel. as i enter the curve at 30mph, i accelerate hard as soon as the front wheels have passed the mid point of the curve. 

if the car easily remains in its lane, i repeat the process at triple the posted speed.

the x3 easily handles this ""experiment"" and the feeling is that it could go at the corner at more than 3x the posted ""suggested"" speed. the acura (old version with the turbo 4 and sh-awd could do this all day.) the new one plows and crosses the center line. the volvo was a t6 type r and it felt in good control of its understeering urges too. but the volvo was much closer to its limit since it didn't shift enough power aft since there technically was no actual loss of traction.

the x3 was the natural -- were money no object, the x3 with the i6 turbo would clearly be the one to get if you wanted some salt and pepper on your ""meat."""

likewise, i shopped the is350 fsports and they were all over $50k (if they were awd).

we need to talk about either sub-compacts or compacts here. since the msrp's (from a practical standpoint) are all over the board, we need to think, for example, 3 series, not 3 series until they exceed $40 or $45k.

those who lease (apparently the majority) shop mo pay, not msrp. and those who do buy, well, of course they're welcome too. i am simply arguing to be inclusive.

spend some time on the mercedes-benz benz build your own board and see how quickly the c class heads up up and away. even the ats when well equipped goes ballistic with aplomb and ease.


mark, i think it seems there is a vantage point gap between you and some other guys here. you seem to be getting mostly top of the line, or at least well into the options, whereas a lot if other guys seem to be fishing in much less equipped ponds and get freaked out by anything more than 50 on the sticker. they said so repeatedly. it may be because they live by their memories (what it used to cost), or perhaps by simply how much they could afford. for myself, i don't look at car at their base. if i can't afford its mid-to-high option version, the car is not for me. i see no point is a stripper, but i understand why somebody may actually go for it. but that vantage point difference is very real. i generally agree with inclusion of 335 in this class, but it barely squeaks into. s4 used to be imho above 335, but that was before they eliminated v6 version of audi and s4 took its place, giving space to rs4/5. i totally disagree on m or rs. there is absolutely nothing entry level about it, from pricing, to chassis, to engineering. zero. other than superficial likeness, those are different car than their lower cousins, essentially from ground up. small size? porsches are even smaller, so what? that's not enough."

i think the goal was to show that the bmw is not the end all of sports sedan ad that it could be ""beaten"" by a lowly honda.

but, we need to keep in mind that we are talking about under 1 second between the three which most of us would never feel. imho, day to day living with the s4 or bmw would be better than in the honda type r. i presume the r would be better suited to a 20 something than my 50+ yo body."

the acura, upon first test drive (in a day with several test drives over identical routes and speeds, etc) was ""close to"" a 2011 audi s4 premium+ without any additional options (that is, it did not have the torque vectoring option called sport differential.)

many -- myself included -- scoff or repress a scoff (that's me) -- whenever i utter or type those words. but damnit jim, i'm a doctor, not a plumber, no wait, i'm a software guy not a professional car reviewer.

but there it is -- a $47,000+ acura tl drives and feels pretty much like a potentially $59,000 audi s4 (if they are equipped similarly the audi's price shoots up, big time.) a serious automobile magazine comparison of the two car may not convice you that the acura should be shopped against the audi, but the numbers (produced and recorded for both car) are not that far apart -- and it feels as if the acura and the audi are twin-sons of different mothers or something akin to that.

look here:

http://www.automobilemag.com/reviews/driven/1008_2010_acura_tl_sh_awd_vs_2010_au- di_s4/viewall.html

in any case, i was driving a 2009 audi audi 2.0t prestige w/sport package and 19"" wheels and tires with audi drive select for pete's sake -- and i wanted a new 2012 audi. a reasonably well equipped audi (not s4) could be had for about $47,000, so the acura, at the price, seemed a good place to compare.

problem was, the audi came back at a 42 month lease point that was much higher than the acura's lease point for 36 months.

bzzz. a 4-cyc audi w/211 hp (and it seemed smaller than the acura) vs an acura w/305 hp with every possible do dad that acura throws on these car?

even the loyalty and ""pull"" of 29 previous audis could not make me cough up the extra money (which would have been about $200 per month).

in any case, given an identical deal, i probably would have re-upped for the audi (at the time, in fact, i am certain i would have); but the dollar done me in. hell, at the time, for the exact same money, i probably would have gone for a volvo volvo t6 awd with a few option boxes ticked off.

now, 5,000 miles later -- i am, i admit it -- very pleased with my decision and love to press down on the accelerator and be rewarded with great power and power delivered as if it were coming from an ultra smooooooth turbine.

new names appear all the time on this and the other places i post -- i can't keep up with who is a new and who is an old participant. 

when i read posts that make what are presented as facts (or near-facts), i determine their veracity based on the poster's frame of reference.

every post does not need to establish ""your"" background -- but, from time to time, refreshing the reader's memory as to where you are coming from, increases my interest in and the value of your post's point.

finally, in my experience, revealing something about your ownership history, will also tend to suggest how your thoughts might be weighted or biased.

i'll try to keep my re-posts of my auto ownership to a minimum. i am, however, certain, i will either make a statement or correct another's and be challenged (for instance on my ""bias"" for rwd biased awd that employs torque vectoring, and, if possible, a torsen differential.) after so many audis and so many driving schools, i feel up to the task of arguing what, how and why in response to a factual irregularity that may be made on the subject.

i just got my 35k mile service at 34k miles (did it early). i did it early mainly due to the fact i skipped/missed my 30k mile oil change. don't listen to audi if you plan on keeping the car a long time; best advice is change the oil every 5k miles no matter how good the oil is. if you plan on not keeping it much past the 50k warranty, then audi's advice to do 10k maintenance intervals is sound. otherwise, the best advice i've received is that it is not a good idea to skimp. 


so why not follow manufacture recommended service? what do you know that others don't?
i know what not one but two highly trusted mechanic's/shop manager's said. 

i also know that manufacturer's have a built-in incentive to make car last as long as the warranty, but no longer. planned obsolescence forces you to buy more new car more frequently. this strategy works great except some manufacturer's have the decency to have the experience of their customer's more in mind rather than just the short-term bottom line. also, a lot of luxury companies still offer either free maintenance, or try to sell discounted packaged pre-paid maintenance. it's a lot cheaper and easier to sell if you can say 50k miles of maintenance, and only have 5 service visits. they only need to make it last the term of the warranty, or the lease. an owner might have other desires and concerns."

,,"i'm not so sure it's obsolescence, per se. but, i do think that the electronics aren't fully developed in car to accept what has been a dizzying expansion of chips, pcbs, computers and software used to operate car.

amazing to me that the (using another acronym) ecu to precisely measure the exact amount of fuel required in each cylinder to maximize power and economy is amazing in and of itself. overall, the car companies have that one nailed.

another case in point, it's pretty amazing that most car with the capability to tell the driver when his oil needs to be changed, based on sensors monitoring operating temp, mode of driving, etc, is equally amazing.

where they fall down, is they don't put as much effort into understanding how the stereo is supposed to work with an ipod (probably the single most ubiquitous media device currently on the planet). or, in audi's case, how they can't even get cds to play correctly. this, a technology that's been around for at least 30 years (and will probably be dead before the end of the decade).

it's not just audi i'm picking on. i've heard wide spread reports of this from people who own gm car, the issues with ford's sync, etc. even my bmw e92 had stereo and nav issues (minor in comparison to the audi mmi), and that platform had been around for awhile.

my personal opinion, if you're going to be nonchalant about the electronics and features of your car, don't put them in the car to begin with. they again, they appear to be ""behind the time"" if they don't have those features. so, they prefer to half-assed measures just so they can list a ""feature"" in marketing brochures.

one thing i have to do, is to tip my hat to the japanese lux manufacturers. there's not one acura, lexus or infiniti that i've been in that the tech hasn't worked the way it's supposed to. they put the effort and time in to make it work.

speaking of which, just got off the phone with the audi dealer. they still don't know what's wrong, but do have the mmi apart (assuming the dash is apart, as is the console since the mmi controller resides there). i inquired about the trans/audi binding issue. they haven't even begun that trouble shooting process. they did say the audi ""rep"" is due to come in to look at my car. but, that's not until mid next week.

so, i'm still tooling around in their audi 2.0. while this is a nice car. it's not an sx audi vehicle. we had a dusting of snow this a.m. it did just fine. but, it's a big car. as good as the 4 cyl turbo is, (and it's really good), it's still hauling around a heavy car, and you feel it."

,,"the audi offers, 3 1/2 different modes with the tiptronic and ads (d, s and m#1 and m#2, providing the ""1/2"" mode):

d = drive mode (but you get drive toyota or drive auto)
s = sport mode (still fully automatic shifting, but you get drive dynamic until you exit sport mode) 
m = manual mode #1 - where ""it"" decides how long you stay in m mode; ""it"" decides when to take you back to d mode or s mode if you have used the paddle shifters and were either in drive or sport when you used the paddle.
m = manual mode #2 - where it stays where you keep it, unless you slow below ""lugging"" then it will downshif from bmw, to mn, where ""n"" is a lower gear based on road speed. 

in manual mode #2, i do not actually know if you were in m4, for instance and pressed the pedal to the metal if it would down shift or not. i thought i had read somewhere that kickdown was either disabled or that you had to push through the resistance (resistance is futile -- the borg!)

his ""settling"" on these rare cream puff car allows him to spend lots of time on the west coast of florida on a houseboat, sailing, fishing and sitting in the sun drinking a cold beer.

whenever i get a new car, i take it to him and we go out for a long test drive -- with him behind the wheel. i can tell he loves the car and probably he hopes that when i get rid of it, he can be the next owner.

my wife and i work (long hours, typically), enjoy fine dining, wine, european travel and ellps car. we probably could afford (that is the deal could be done) for an audi rs7 ($120,000 msrp). we'd have to settle on other things were we to go for the rs. 

instead we decided to set our sites on far less expensive car (mine was $57k, hers $65k), we bought hers and leased mine. the burden for both is $1,400 per month, all in. 

our next door neighbor has a new 750 bmw -- and a toyota -- the bimmer costs as much as both of our car combined. the guy across the street has a hyundai and a yukon but also owns 1/5th of an airplane. we're all settling in our own ways. car are, for me, slowly, very slowly, beginning to be less important to me at 63 than they were when i was 50. my wife, oddly, seems to be picking up the slack -- wanting the highest hp she can get (within reason, of course).

i think you are looking in the wrong class (size wise) of car. any of these will fit 2 car seat in the back, but fit a 3rd person comfortably in the back with the 2 car seat? i don't think so. are we talking high back booster seat or 5 point harness seat that need to be latched in?

one way to reduce your maintenance costs on a toyota or lexus would be to pay attention when you take the car in. don't just drop it off to the service advisor & say, ""the light is on, it needs service."" usually unless it is something major, the car will most likely require a simple oil change when the light comes on."

,,"in 2001 i was in italy a couple of weeks for business and drove some kind of small minivan like vehicle. i can't even remember the make but it was diesel and a manual transmission(5 spd i think). i was impressed with how quiet and smooth it was. i didn't find the torque disappearing and remember driving around lake garda and the curvy roads enjoying the scenery and shifting through the gears. freeways were also worry free. i remember being passed by a smart on the freeway at about 150 klicks and saying ""holy crap, i wouldn't go that fast in that thing!""

point is, i think it depends on the particular diesel engine. i also believe i would try at a least a couple of modern diesels with 7-8 spd auto trannies before i made a blanket statement that all diesels belong in semis or farm tractors."

,,"andres3 said:at my last hpde event i won an auction to get more than half off on a audi s4 3.0 supercharge tune that takes the s4 to 400+ hp. they couldn't make the tune happen on a sunday, so it'll happen at my next hpde event in march. this is a tune that turns the s4 into a bmw killer. since my car has been pretty much flawless, i think i will go ahead and risk the potential ""warranty"" issues. it's already a beast; should be fun.
i have a question (prompted by an article i read about the rs7): audi, today, uses the dsg transmission on the s4, s5, s6 and s7, for instance. yet on the rs7 they use the 8-speed tiptronic. the stated reason is that the currently available dsg can't take the forces generated by the rs7's engine. the article said the s6 was on the cusp of stressing the dsg -- and owners of an s6 were cautioned not to after-market upgrade the hp and torque (which is quite possible with the turbo s6 v8, e.g.).

can the dsg in the s4 handle the upgrade you are contemplating and have a good long life? if not, what is the cost -- or risk in this upgrade?

my dealer says the s4 is going to have a horsepower and torque boost to keep it ahead of the standard v6t in the 2016 audi line. it means, to me, that they have resolved the dsg issue; wonder if there is the headroom in the current dsg to take the upgrade is my concern."

as for better in the class, once again that's a matter of personal taste. i find that the audi audi, audi and audi have arguably the best dash and control layout of the bunch, and while i'm not as fond of the newer/less driver centric control layout of recent bmw, even that interior seems far more functional and logically laid out. geez, i even think the lexus is is better done than the cts, and i am not a fan of the is at all.

i find audi, bmw and kia at top almost shocking. especially audi. interestingly enough, volkswagen is way to the bottom, so it seems even though they share some parts, the overall qc must be much better there. also, porsche being closer to volkswagen than to audi is interesting. 

i will believe chrysler's improvement (it jumped over other domestics) if it remains there for a few years. and where is fiat? off the scale?
audi's been providing the icing with the cake since the mid 2000's. where have you been? 
pretty darn consistent at the top right behind lexus for luxury makes the last 5 years or so. still, not at lexus reliability levels yet (or ever). 

i think we all saw cadillac tumbling coming based on @graphicguy experiences. unlike some that write-off personal experiences reported here as anecdotal, i take it to likely be ""par"" for the course as that is statistically most likely to happen. bmw's improvement is both significant and recent. they weren't that hot in prior years. 

kia has been inching toward the top for awhile now too. one of the reasons i got one, as they surpassed honda and acura for a few years now. audi's qc is most definitely superior to volkswagen's. has been for a long time, and most audi's are still made in europe while volkswagen's in mexico. 

as to chrysler's improvement, they had no where to go but up.

,,"the bmw would certainly do your jobs but the bmw is hardly ""luxury"". audi is cramped in the back and the c class can be very variable on built quality/reliability. no idea about the acura, we simply don't see them in europe.

$22k would buy you an '07 or possibly '08 volvo se lux here in u.k. and enough change for a good weekend away...........ditto for an volvo which is even nicer.

of course you can elect to keep the 10k interval and for all i know things will be fine -- we have decided at this time we want to be more than fine and figured doubling up on the oil and filter changes is worth doing.

we are, too, planning on buying the service packs at 45k which will provide no charge services at 55k and 65k. we will, however, keep up the every other interval (meaning double) practice.

mine (the s4) can be cpo's prior to 50k miles which will extend the warranty to 100k miles -- my wife's, since we own it, cannot be cpo'd, but we're going to run the risk of something bad happening and go ""naked"" after 50k on the sq5. the plan, currently, is to trade the sq5 around 90k, since a big hit in depreciation happens when you drive the car off the lot and again at close to 100k.

,,"the 3% number for premium car with manual transmissions is the number the enthusiasts magazines used in 2010. i would assume the number has declined what with the increase in excellent 6, 7, and 8 speed ""clutchless"" automatics.

for those of you who see no merit in comparing a tl sh-awd to an s4, i do understand your incredulity. i was exactly in that mind-set until i drove the two car back to back one long afternoon of test driving in june or july, 2011.

there is no way the s4 is not more satisfying and overall believable as a performance car. nevertheless, the tl sh-awd with the 19"" wheels, driven exactly over the same test drive route and the same speeds (up to 90mph) feels somewhat like a diluted s4. the s4 is the better machine, there is no argument from me on that point. where i found myself able to rationalize and accept the tl (after 29 audis in a row) was when i contented the two similarly and found the audi required an msrp bump in excess of $11,000. 

i live in cincinnati, a small honda or a big town, replete with at least twice-daily traffic clogs on our three interstates. the chances, my chances, that is, of being able to ever tap the potential of the s4 continue to erode -- although there remain a few chances to make forward progress at speeds in excess of 65mph. the s4 does rip through the tl's performance envelope, but the tl sh-awd with the 19"" wheel and tire upgrade rips through most other car's performance envelopes -- but even then, there is a decreasing window of opportunity to use its performance.

i have not been drinking any kool-aid -- i am not suggesting you should succumb to the price differential if you are willing and able to pay the price for an s4 prestige with several options that crank its price up over 5 figures more than the tl.

what i am suggesting, or asking, is that you do test drive a tl sh-awd advance or tl sh-awd tech with the upgraded wheels and tires and with the super slick 6-speed stick.

it is difficult to learn to love, let alone like, the tl's nose and butt, and the interior has ""too much honda"" in it -- but damn, the tl sh-awd advance can be loaded up with options and leased for less than $550 per month for 36 months. if you have not driven this car equipped thusly, i believe you will be impressed.

,,"i'm currently on a business trip in michigan and today my client (whose spouse is a gm engineer) says, ""come on; let's go drive a new cts."" i agreed and away we went.

first off, this car is actually halfway decent looking, and while the family resemblance to the butt ugly first generation cts is definitely there, it is none-the-less sort of pleasing to look at in an angular sort of way. then i got in and was surprised to find myself sitting lower than in my old 1985 dodge daytona (i was expecting a seating position more in keeping with my 530i), and while the seating position wasn't at all uncomfortable, i just thought it odd given that this car is a mid-sized sedan.

the rest of the interior seems to be reasonably well thought out, and once again a vast improvement to the gen 1 car. all in all, a place where i would generally feel comfortable for a long drive. then there was the back seat, geez can looks be deceiving or what? visually it looks large back there, however, upon entering i bashed my head on the steeply raked c pillar, and then landed with a thump down low once again. the problem here is that while the seat cushion in low, the floor isn't. i'm only 5' 8"" and yet with my feet shoved as far forward under the front seat as i could, my thighs were rising from my hips at an angle of greater than twenty degrees. said another way, my knees were a good eight inches higher than my hips, not a good recipe for a comfortable place to sit on a long drive.

speaking of the drive, the first thing i noticed was that the steering wasn't as heavy as i would have preferred, however, for the general driving public that may not be a bad thing. personally i prefer the heavy steering of the bmw; however, i've heard lots of folks complain that many models from bmw and mercedes-benz benz have steering that is too heavy, so for them, the cts is probably just about perfect.

found a nice country road, pulled away from a stop light and nailed it, holding full throttle through the 1-2 gear change and beyond. geez was that lame. the software that controls this thing actually backed the throttle off so that the tranny could sort of ooze into second gear. ewwww. fwiw, i mentioned to the spouse my impressions of the gear change issue and was told later in the day that a software fix was already completed and this car just needed to get patched. personally i could care less about how the automatic performs as i'd rather have a manual, but come on; our minivans have more positive shifting than this thing. i found myself asking out loud how a transmission like that even saw the light of day.

back to the drive. if that engine has 300 horsepower, then either that car is seriously heavy, or that engine is seriously anemic. my butt-o-meter tells me that the new cts with a slushbox tranny is probably no faster than say 0-60 in the low sixes. ride wise, the car was reasonably compliant and seemed to handle well enough, that said, the tires on this thing seemed to be of the relatively narrow all-season variety, so i'm assuming that this wasn't a sport model (if there even is such a thing), and as such cannot judge it too harshly.

long story short, bmw needn't be worried about this car, it seems to be targeted more at the toyota toyota / lexus es crowd than at the folks who buy bmw and bmw car for their driving dynamics.

i'll jump in here. it's kind of silly to pretend that every buyer is the same. i know when i was looking at more compact premium sedan a number of years back, i looked at the volkswagen and the audi audi. i also looked at the honda, tl, and acura a number of years ago. some people who are very badge conscious won't do that. others will not care about a badge as long as a vehicle has what they want. and what they want has a lot of variation, too. 

some people look at ellps for the ""l""; some look more for the ""p"". depending upon which factors are important, cross-shopping with the more ""plebian"" brands may or may not occur.

what i suspect is true is that there are *fewer* people who will cross shop. but not nobody. and any of us who pretends we know that percentage is just guessing."
,,"i live near a mercedes-benz benz dealer in the county just north of the greater cincinnati area. as such, i receive mailings all the time from the dealer, given they captured my contact info when i was helping my sister buy a c class several months ago.

knowing that the ""new"" c class was on its way, i told her to hold on for 6-8 months to look at the ""all new"" 2015 c. but, everyone knew the new c was just around the corner, so the dealers and mercedes-benz benz were really aggressive pricewise in selling the '14s.

anyway, got an email from one of the new sales people at the local mercedes-benz benz dealer that was obviously culled from my company's database showing what i'm sure is the only person who works for my company within a 250 mile area (probably bigger). they were having some private showing of a gts. i ended up on the list to attend a ""look see"".

clearly, they didn't have access to my salary info if they thought i was a target customer for the amg gt-s. but, i had heard about it, read about it, thought it was ""cool"" so yeah....i'll eat free canapes if they let me sit in it. if they let me drive it....even better.

i'll cut to the chase. they didn't let me drive it. got to sit in it, though. i hate the new ""flat"" paint jobs these car have. but, i guess the very high end car are all getting them, mercedes-benz benz amg is no exception.

can't really see paying as much for a car as a starter home costs, but if you have the disposable income to do so, you'd probably be hard pressed to find a nicer car.

as i wandered from the hoard who was engulfing shrimp cocktail and pate, i spied a humble mercedes-benz benz outside. steel grey with red leather (the real stuff....not the fake stuff mercedes-benz benz tries to tell you is ""better than leather"" (it's not). this wasn't the 400, but the lowly 300 with a turbo 4 cyl. sales guy spots me, asks me what i thought. told him i liked the color combo better than any i'd seen so far.

at the autu show this past winter, they were showing one that was black on black without the sport package....pretty dour. this one, was quite different. very pretty. sales guy has keys and a dealer tag before i knew he had left. ""go for a spin?"". 

""i'm not in the market"".

sales-""i'd rather take you for a test drive and hope you remember me when you are in the market.""

""fair enough"".

it's taken me awhile, but i've finally wrapped my head around sports sedan with 4 cyl. actually, these turbo motors really do honda me. they're torquey. more fuel efficient. lighter. and generally, they may not be faster, but just more fun to drive than the recent 6 cyl car i've had recently. truth told, they're pretty damned quick in their own right.

this one is no different. i don't know the specs, but it's typical. no turbo lag that i could ascertain. quick off the line. pulled hard over a broad rpm range. it was quieter than the growl my cts gives off (which i like). 7 speed trans that you have to goad a bit to downshift, but steering wheel paddles help with this. it's smoother than my cts trans, but i've got one less gear and my trans is already pretty smooth already (gm knows how to make a good automatic trans). 

c seat i really liked...even better than my ""go to"" sport seat in the tl sh awd. the mercedes-benz benz felt tailored to me. i think most of that is due to the very soft leather (again, no hard ""pleather"") and the crazy amount of adjustments you can make to them....including power thigh extenders.

my cts seems faster, but again, the c is no slouch. cts suspension is geared more towards handling. c is geared more towards ride, but certainly could hold its own. at least that's the first impression over what was a 20 minute test drive.

now, my cts interior is no slouch in the build and materials category. real wood, leather, suede, aluminum, is well put together, inside and out...probably the best gm has ever done with any car they've built........ever!

c class is over the top, especially at the price point. again, real leather, aluminum and the switches were the same as i just had seen in the amg just 30 minutes earlier. they felt the same, too. mercedes-benz benz leather is better than cadillac leather, which is really good in and of itself. porous wood, is better than cts polished wood (which again, is really, really good).

i didn't like the new trend of the ""screen as an afterthought"". cadillac does a much better job. i don't like the trans ""stalk"", but understand that's a mercedes-benz benz trade mark (really?). my cts is bigger, but hte c felt more comfortable.

final thoughts. the c stickered for right around $50k. their discount, my corporate discount, probably put it somewhere in the $44k-$45k range. at that price? a very compelling car. the interior is what would sell it. it's competitive everywhere else...drive, handling, performance...with the 3, a, etc. ats is edgier (as is my cts).

maintenance? included with cadillac for 4 years. way cheaper than mercedes-benz benz after warranty period, too.

i'd consider one on my next pruchase...probably put it near the top."

,,i have nothing to add to this besides my thanks- excellent post- interesting when someone runs the numbers- and comes up with a value creative post.
,,i just can't see going 6cyl on the entry car as making any sense. it destroys the handling and further bloats up an already bloated acura relative to the original. and even bmw is going 4cyl. just seems like a bigger bloated entry boat of a car isn't the way to go.
,,"it's the fact that the new 3 series is a bit too heavy and a bit too isolated from the driving experience. the consensus on the new transmission is that it's not nearly as good as the previous generation model, either. essentially the 3 series has priced and sized itself out of the market and a lot of people wish they had bought the 1 series instead.

acura has the same problem as well. the current generation models are much larger than their predecessors and while they are nicer looking and feeling inside, they really don't drive any better. in fact, if anything, it's a bit worse for the same sort of reasons as the bmw. unfortunately, acura doesn't sell a smaller car than the acura in the u.s.

note, this also applies to many other makers. the cts, for instance, is a 5 series competitor and doesn't belong here either. the new ats should, though. the infiniti is honestly right at the upper end of what's acceptable, especially since you really don't need the awd version. awd is only a must for fwd car in this class. but it's still quite heavy.

now, my favorite car in this class, is the mazda. yes, i know, the stupid rear doors aren't exactly styled and put on right, but it's really a sedan masquerading as a ""coupe"". 3000lbs almost exactly and it handles like a dream as you'd expect. it might not be the fastest or the best on a test track, but it dodges in and out of traffic like a go-kart by comparison to most other car."
,,"andres3....don't use my experience as a measuring stick. i came to the conclusion a while ago that both dealers around me have relatively inept service depts. but, as long as they keep me in some nice loaners (which they have), i'll put up with it...at least until the new '15 tls come out. 

i'm half tempted to pull a sweet deal on a '13-'14 tl given the deals they're making. i really did like what they did with the '13 my sister bought....they made a lot of subtle refinements and updates that made the whole car a nicer piece."

,,"and the punchline is: ""he only took tips!"" 

a tip for those who are either owners of or contemplating one of these ellps or ellpsuv/cuv's -- assuming the vehicle in question is not a bmw. 

here goes: many, probably most of these car tend toward -- or outright already have -- some degree of nose heaviness. audi is certainly not known for ""50 - 50"" weight balance, for instance. acura, volvo and most certainly others (again not bmw) are absolutely nose heavy when configured as 2wd vehicles (since they mostly are fwd when ordered thusly). more and more of these ellp vehicles are ordered every year with 4-driven wheels (the up take here in sw ohio is now for ""mostly"" awd versions -- even most bmw's and mercedes-benz benz are acquired with awd so say the dealers). alas, even the awd versions are nose-heavy. 

the thing that i've learned that is a quick, easy and virtually free way to improve upon some of the effects of being a bit porky on the front is to inflate the front tires +2 pounds more than the rear tires; and, typically to inflate the fronts to one or two pounds more than the factory sticker suggests.

my s4 says to inflate the tires at max to 42 pounds. i inflate front to 43 and rear to 41 (using the free nitrogen ""air"" costco offers its members).

we had a cold snap here in river honda yesterday -- of course the air pressure in all four tires dropped dramatically -- we went from 70+ degrees to overnight temps in the upper teens with a daytime high an optimistic 41.

since i was at costco getting my fill up of their top-tier premium, i also went for the free air fill-up. based on the length of time before the ""ding"" indicating 43 pounds, the pressure had to have been over 5 or 6 pounds below that. 

to ensure the tires were cold, i drove to costco, parked and went shopping in the store for a while, then went to the tire dept for my fill-up.

i kid you not -- and i've known this for years, yet i was as pleasantly surprised as could be -- the turn-in was immediately sharper, like the car had been placed on a set of shiny new rails.

ok, that is the ""free"" (as in almost zero cost) tip.

here's one, that when coupled with the above free tip, will further dramatically improve your heavy nosed (and this one works on any car) ellp vehicle's steering dynamics: switching out of the factory tires (unless certain tires are already on your ellp car) into the top of the line performance tires in the class (of tire) that you would normally drive.

for example -- here in sw ohio -- no one (well, virtually no one) uses ""summer"" and ""winter"" tires -- they use either ""summer"" tires year round or (more likely) all-season tires, year round.

the germans have even gone so far as to specify as no cost options, typically, the ability to order your car with summer only or all season rubber. dealers typically order their for-stock vehicles with all-season rubber to keep their customers from complaining about the super fast tire wear and the almost unusable traction summer tires offer to those of us who do have temps that go below 40 - 45 degrees from time to time (our typical winters are usually above freezing, but usually below 45 which is the kryptonite temp for summer only tires).

the thing is, a lot of the ""all-season"" tires are either grand touring tires or are simply h rated all-seasons (generally from a well-known brand and generally with a fairly long tread-life expectation).

my s4 came with h rated grand touring tires. what were they thinking? offered up to order is an s4 with either summer or all-season tires. i checked the all-season box since, well, you know, i live in cincinnati and we really (usually) have very mild winters in terms of both temp and snowfall. why do i need dedicated winter tires in my climate, so to speak? 

i don't. 

grand touring tires are fine -- but, if you ax' me they have no business on an audi s car of any stripe.

what is better -- much much better? easy-peasy: an ultra-high performance all-season tire from one of the name brands all of the german's buy from. we ended up with continental extremecontact dws ultra high performance all-seasons from tire rack -- shipped to the dealer, installed and road-force balanced. these tires should have their picture placed beside the word ""sticky"" in your merriam-webster.

they have super-stiff (compared to the rather comfy-biased grand touring h rated rubber that the s4 came with) sidewalls and they are y speed-rated. of course, since i ordered my car with the all-season tire option, audi saw fit to engage a max-speed limiter that tops out at 130 (easily switched off, if you really think you're going to need to exceed 130mph). 

so, you can, for relatively little money (close to zero) noticeably improve your ellp's turn-in, gas mileage and overall handling by simply cranking up the fronts to +2 pounds over the rears and by cranking up the front 1 or 2 pounds over the door jam's ""suggestion.""

then for what will probably amount to $700 to $1,000 all-in (but for some of these car that you can order 20"" wheels, the $ amount will be higher), you can take the next big step and get rid of the almost certainly ""wimpy"" tires the manufacturers seem to put on these car when the ""no summer only"" tire option is checked.

virtually all of these ellps, ellpsuv/cuv vehicles are nose heavy -- which manifests itself as under-steer. it is unlikely you can, as the saying goes, put lipstick on a pig and turn it into a porsche in the handling department -- but, with my hand raised on high, i can attest that by doing both of the suggested tips above, i even transformed my tl advance from somewhat of a farm-implement (i.e., it could tend to ""plow"" a little bit even with sh-awd) due to its less than ideal 60-40 (or something like that) f/r weight distribution) into a confidence inspiring and -- with a consideration for its price -- ""s4-light"" ellps.

of course, in the case of the acura tl advance w/sh-awd the 19"" h rated tires that it came with couldn't have sucked anymore even if their name was hoover (i crack myself up).

so, my friends and fellow posters, if you're laying out something north of $45,000, you can for no to relatively low money transform your baby from ""nice"" to a vehicle that, quoting my wife, ""goes like a snake in a rat hole.""

if you play your cards right, you can make the uhp all-seasons (or whatever you and your ""climate"" could call optimum) part of the purchase/lease deal when you order the car or before you sign on the dotted line to buy/lease one off the lot.

hopefully the above will have some merit and even more $ value and most of all ""fun to drive"" value for at least one forum participant.

,,"the nissan/infiniti engine is one of the really solid engines...it's still the base for the current nissan/infiniti engines. it is not the most thrify on gas, neither is it the worst. it is possible that not using high test is effecting your mileage, but i've tried 93 octane and 87 octane in my 06 m35 and i've seen no difference in mpg or pep. a larger factor is ethanol in your gasoline (unavoidable today) which gives you less mpg then 100% gasoline. i doubt that octane is causing any problem in this engine however you can try three tanks of high test and see if you see any significant difference.

fuel guage is what it is...i think it was the old bmw where they made the guage for the last 1/4 tank of gas almost 3/4 of the guage. it's rare that it matters how full the tank is when it shows full...but it really does matter when you're down to 1/8 a tank.

high performance plugs and ""high efficiency"" air cleaners do almost nothing in a modern engine. actually, most all additives also do nothing, in fact most car makers recommend against using any additives in the car.

,,"honestly sometimes the snobbery stereotypes of bmw drivers are apparent even in this forum. really, your car doesn't measure testosterone levels.
i'm not particularly a huge fan of bmw, but i can admire their vehicles and what they've done in the marketplace.
to me, being ""sporty"" is not about horsepower or torque. sure, that's nice, but if that were what was important i'd buy a vette or a chevrolet. straight-line acceleration is not what makes an ellps appealing to me.
i admire and appreciate, shall we say, ""precision"". i like precise, tight steering. i like a reasonably comfortable, yet firm and precise ride. i like going around corners, not at 0.8g, but in a way that the steering feel is precise, i know exactly where the car is going to go, and i can feel the feedback through the steering wheel. i don't even particularly care to autocross my vehicles or pull high g's in corners.
so i also like a ""nice"" interior. i can get fairly lower-horsepower, ""precise"" vehicles at reasonable cost (the mazda 3 comes to mind). but those vehicles usually don't have the ""nicer"" interiors that i like. it was all of these thoughts and characteristics that caused me to buy an audi in the late '90's. and now i drive an '05 tl, and you know what - although the interior is ""nice"" and the horsepower is quite good, the driving dynamics are still a bit too floaty/boaty and lacking.
so i don't begrudge somebody liking a 320i. it's not all about testosterone, or horsepower, at least to some of us. and it's not about snobbery, either. we all have different needs and tastes. insulting each others' rides - well, pretty childish imho."

also prices have continued to skyrocket in ellps. i know what i bought my audi audi for in 1998, and i'm not gonna spend my money on their current prices. so ellps is more or less out of what i want to pay.

however there are some decently compelling ""mundane"" car that can be loaded up to levels that approach (and sometimes exceed) ellps. if you want the badge then you go ellps. if you want much of the actual benefit and to save some cash, then dropping down a market notch is not a bad idea."

i don't think being an ""auto enthusiustt"" puts anyone in a special category. even people that don't live car have brains and can recognise value. 

i never even insinuated that most people crossshop those kinds of car but i know that a lot do. it's silly to assume that just because a couple of friends don't do something that eveyone else in the country doesn't either. if you would say something like ""imo i don't think most people shop for car that way based on a few of friends buying habits"". then it's clear you really don't know but you have an opnion. but, you rarely do that. you just make definitive statements based on huge assumptions.

i would agree that most people probably don't crossshop that way and that is one of the reasons that the car mags test car that are recognised to be in the same category. however, i think another big reason is that car companies don't want their car compared to economy car or luxury car respectively so that is probably one of the conditions that the car companies have when loaning a car for a comparo. in fact, i just read somewhere where lincoln wouldn't provide a lincoln because the mag wanted to use it in a comparo with some mainstream car. i read a lot of car sites so i just can't remember where i read that recently.

,,"didn't forget them at all . . . just thought my [subjective] point had been made. 

hell, i grew up where only rich people's car had a/c and power windows. my dad got a new plymouth in 1969 with power steering -- but no power brakes. and even though it was the top of the line plymouth satellite with a 318 v8 (the 383 and hemi were reserved for the road runner and the 440 was for the gtx), it didn't have factory air -- so my dad had the dealer install aftermarket a/c which meant the front bench seat could only seat two instead of three because of the ""device"" (the blowing unit) that was installed that stuck way out into the passenger area.

the first time i got a car with power steering, brakes and windows, i knew i had become a member of ""the club."" that car was a 1976 chrysler cordoba with fine corithian leather (how many remember that reference?)

it still had an am only radio though, but with a speaker in the rear deck it was ""upscale"" befitting someone of my stature (in ""the club,"" of course.)

and, man o' man, when i got a car that had a rear window defroster (which was a slit in the rear deck through which air was blown by a motor located in the trunk), well, peel me a grape, mabel. 

power door locks engendered a similar reaction when i got a 4-door car with front only power door locks (and, as i recall, front only power windows, too.) the dome light only came on when you opened a front door, on this car -- probably saved $.50 per door to omit the rear on/off switch.

when i got an audi with an infra-red remote (who's dumbass idea was that, anyway? -- infra-red, geesh) -- i had another grape peeling moment as well.

these days its power everything on virtually every car -- and even if you didn't want these assists, well, it would be virtually impossible to not have them.

my 1978 audi 5000 was my first car with heated seat -- i used to take people for rides in the car and secretly turn on the seat heaters. . .why? because back then heated seat were rare (and novel.)

i also didn't forget articulating headlights, nor did i forget bi-xenons (which the acura tl lacks, strangely.)

boxster s (315 hp) @ 2,910 lbs vs. tts roadster (265 hp) @3,394 lbs = +484 lbs; -50 hp

porsche is redesigning the cayman s along the lines of the new boxster, so its weight is anticipated to drop another 80-100 lbs for 2013. 

again, my point isn't that audi doesn't make some great car. they absolutely do. i particularly like the s5 and audi/s7. but the added weight (and awd) makes audi's so-called sports car and sport sedan feel much less nimble than i would prefer. they get decent straight line performance, but, as clint eastwood might say, they have ""trouble with the curves"". at least in imparting the same kind of nimble feel and driving pleasure. 

considering that my 1995 5 passenger nissan nissan se tipped the scales at 3,001 lbs, i'd really like to see similar sized offerings by audi and bmw try to stay in the 3,500 lb range. that gives them an extra 500 lbs for more safety equipment, stronger frame and chassis (although my nissan was as solid at 150k miles as it was new), and techno do-dads. but 4,000 lbs for a mid size sedan is just too much, imo. hell, porsche has now got their cayenne down to under 4,400 lbs; surely they can lend a weight reduction engineer to audi for a few weeks."

is there a spreadsheet (that i don't have to create myself) available (on line) that allows the user to plug in numbers -- and make some assumptions regarding repair and mntce costs -- to come up with the ""cost of ownership"" for buying and holding (at least 5 years) vs leasing (for at least 3 years)? i'd appreciate a url if anyone here knows of one. 

i mentioned this before -- and it did have to do with a gm car in the spirit of full disclosure -- but my neighbor with 80k on his somewhat late model ""paid for"" pontiac bonneville was, according to him, making maintenance and repair payments that were not too far below his financing payments. he went ahead and got a new big-boy dee-lux cuv (chevrolet) using the logic that if he was going to make payments on a crappy, unreliable, old car, why not make the same payments and be driving a new car with a warranty.

he also bought a super-nice ford four door pickup truck (with what darn near looks like a car interior, only nicer) -- and plans to keep it until the wheels turn square. perhaps ford trucks are really hard to kill or wound.

took my s4 in for the 35k service interval + a tire rotation last thursday night; got an audi with 5k miles on it; car was apparently a base model with 19"" wheels, winter package (f/r heated seat, steering wheel) and led headlights. for all intents and purposes, the window sticker i found in the glove box bottom lined at $69k. the option packages did not include the upgraded sound system, but, oddly nav and voice command and bt communications and wifi hotspot were all included. it also had premium paint (a kind of crystal black). perhaps premium+ doesn't merit a separate line item (which i thought odd, since there was an audi prestige on the showroom floor).

the audi was sublime -- library quiet, supple, smooth -- the thing oozed from point a to point b. as col potter once said, ""there aren't enough o's in smooth to describe it."" of course he was talking about some very old scotch whisky as i recall.

the upgraded wheels and tires (with all-season designation) were probably on the car for styling purposes since the car lacked the sport suspension option. but i hoped the audi would be a true luxury performance sedan -- especially for nearly $70k.

in a straight line and at triple digit speeds, the car was, to repeat, sublime. however, i really could not find much of that german taught feel i assumed would be present. oh hell, the thing seemed very close to mushy, with ample body roll and, despite quick turn-in, a huge tendency toward understeer at any slightly above posted limits upon entering a curve or twisty section of highway.

i had been, previously, loaned an audi with all of the sport option boxes checked off and it seemed much much better than the audi.

the thing sure was purty however -- but not nearly $10k more beautiful than a comparable audi -- and driving it although not exactly a chore, was, hmm, rather a disappointment. 

i was able to pull into the dealer in the audi and five minutes later drive out in my s4 -- the main straight line difference was that the s4 is not quite as quiet as the audi, but everything else about the s4 -- from the sound system to the sound of the engine at full cry -- was superior. 

now, then, however, would i have the need to drive myself and 3 passengers on a 100 mile trip to columbus, louisville or indianapolis, well the extra rear seat leg room of the audi would be appreciated.

i guess the s car have the power to spoil (me at least). i simply would not pay the extra $13k for a relatively stripped audi -- and if they were both $57k, the s4 would still be my first choice. makes me wonder how much better, even, the b9 s4 will be over the audi's.

drive it like you live. 
i just got my 35k mile service at 34k miles (did it early). i did it early mainly due to the fact i skipped/missed my 30k mile oil change. don't listen to audi if you plan on keeping the car a long time; best advice is change the oil every 5k miles no matter how good the oil is. if you plan on not keeping it much past the 50k warranty, then audi's advice to do 10k maintenance intervals is sound. otherwise, the best advice i've received is that it is not a good idea to skimp. 

what did your 35k s4 service include?

i told them to include the engine air filter whether it said to do it or not. they also did my cabin air filter, the motor oil, and i asked for a front brake service including new fluid as my pads were starting to scratch metal on metal on 1/2"" ring just a week before my scheduled service (took two weeks to get into this shop from when i called; they are too good and popular and busy as a result!). rotors when correctly priced even the large fronts were only $125 each, but still a hard pill to swallow twice now for me (due to track-use). this time, (unlike the first which was totally my fault for ignoring the sensor lights), i didn't get all the dummy light sensors warning me my pads were low; might need to ask audi why the brake pad sensors didn't warn me and to hyundai up for the rotors as a result  also need to ask my shop again what the diagnosis/theory is for the failure of the sensors to warn me i was scoring my rotors with metal on metal contact. perhaps the pads were unevenly worn from overheating during 100+ degree track days; causing the lack of warning. need to follow up with them. my front pads are not really meant to be track abused more than probably 1 weekend (they were put through 2 as well as 19,000 miles).

cr came out with 2014/15 results of the most reliable car brands, and audi as real-world observance between you and i seems to agree with, is at the top of the chart along with a couple others for good reason. impeccably built, quality controlled, and constructed is what comes to mind as the right words.

i was charged 2.1 hours for 35k service which included the oil/filter, air filter, cabin pollen filter, brake fluid flush, & inspection. 
charged 1.5 hours to replace the front rotors and pads."

the previous generation s could manage to barely eek into this category with a ~3400lb weight. (though fwd did kind of keep it from being a true contender)

the sport package on the 320i is really a great package, give you all the suspension parts , seat, and steering wheel (m sport) wheels and tires plus for the first time the 320i can be had with the m sport adjustable suspension, this is part of the track package. when it comes to leasing, a bmw with the same packages as the 320i, will lease for less money or slightly more. so the bmw over all is a better value."

nothing helped the manufacturers increase the prices more than captive financing. those subsidies partially offset the effective price increases (overall cost of car probably did not go as much up as the stickers if we compare it with loans prior interest rate bubble of 2000s), but create a dangerous situation when the rates go up (ad they will). we will be stuck with much higher prices then."

,,"technically the macan shares about 33% of its dna with the audi audi/sq5. the two local audi retailers happen to own porsche dealerships -- kind of an interesting ""battle of the brands"" with shoppers cross shopping sq5's with the base macan. apparently, if you know where to look, you can actually see the audi markings on frame members of the macan.

of course my audi rep thinks the macan costs $10-$15k more than an sq5, and has made a sticker comparison to demonstrate that.

frankly, having driven both of them, my take is that for once the audi interior is second to the macan's and the macan has noticeably lower ground clearance. from a power perspective, the audi has both more hp and torque, but the porsche's torque, derived as it is from turbo charging comes on at a lower rpm.

the sq5, were it to offer the german market lowered suspension (which it does not, here in the us), seems to be more car for the money -- but, ahem, what price the porsche medallion? the porsche uses a 7-speed dual clutch unit and the sq5 uses an 8-speed tiptronic with software that does a pretty good impression of a dual clutch feel. 

lots of options available on the macan -- and those options can crank a macan over $100,000. our lowly sq5 prestige with a couple of options and in panther black with red leather seat came in at $65,000. 

despite the similarities, there are obvious porsche touches that are included in that 67% uniqueness -- and while you may argue their value-prop, they certainly do imbue the macan with porsche-ness; and, no amount of leather or paint will make the sq5 a porsche. 

you may cross shop them and i'm certain the country-club valet will give either car you hop out of nothing other than a ton of respect (and will likely avert his eyes), but one, after all is a friggin' porsche.

drive it like you live.

nb: my wife decided the sq5 would be a repeat, primarily because she likes being a bit higher off the ground and because the back seat of the macan takes a big hit in headroom and cargo space in exchange for having a swoopy rear-end. the audi, then, gets a nod toward ""practicality"" if you can imagine hauling groceries in a $65,000 supercharged 354hp 346 ft/lb torque ""cuv hot-rod!"""

now, me, i go to and from work 5 days per week, travel the 200 mi rt between cincinnati and columbus once per week and sleep late the other day. i do not (and really don't plan to) ""track"" my car (never have).

so i go through german and now japanese ""luxury performance sedan"" one after another -- ordering upsized wheels/tires, sport packages, sport seat, sport suspensions, whatever has sport in it. i used to fight the good fight and order car specifically so that i could get manual shifters. i chipped my turbo car, changed out the air filters and bpv's to squeeze out any additional power i could (from the turbo's of course).

for what?

a quick dash to 35mph, before i had to abruptly mash the brake pedal or rear end the guy parked on the highway in front of me! that's what.

i read the reviews of the new bmw 328 (with the turbo 4), and i really got excited (for about 9 minutes) when i saw the acceleration figures -- but then i thought, ""i probably can't even use that much power on the entrance ramp to i-71s"" (i'd rear end someone.)

nevertheless i continue to want more -- i want my car to be ever quicker (they're already fast, even the puny ones can go 130mph, which is where many of the germans place the ""limiter"") even though it is hard to imagine regularly (or frequently) being able to enjoy the ever quickening acceleration from the americans, europeans and the japanese.

i want ever larger and sticky-er tires, firmly sprung and electronically controlled suspensions, the whole enchilada -- and for what, the one time i can carve that corner (without fear of hitting a deer in the headlights -- literally bambi.)

i have become irrational about the performance -- i want more more more, whereas traffic and circumstances of urbania and even sub-urbania allow less less less -- of the car i drive. perhaps that is why my fondest memory (and my all-time favorite car) is of a 1995 audi s6. at least, way back then, i could actually slip the car into first gear and rapidly release the clutch and floor the accelerator without rear-ending the guy in front of me being my first and foremost thought.

now i am driving a car that is as fast as any on this board and faster than many. moreover, the thing is capable of holding its own in quickness too. good luck in being able to actually enjoy the performance.

yet, with 31 months to go on the lease, i am wondering -- what will be quicker, sticky-er and have more technology next time?

completely irrational.

i'm thinkin' the evolution of the new bmw 3 (in the next 30 months) or the g from infiniti (and possibly another acura) or maybe back to my old love, audi will provide more more more. by then, however, i'd imagine that an occasional sprint to 55 or 60 will seem ""freakin' awesome!""

,,"i've driven them all recently; 1st the bmw - everyone claims it is unequaled in handling. who am i to argue. the steering is very weighty, possibly too much at low speeds for some. it does manage to feel very tight and extremely smooth all at once. definitely the driver's car but if you're on honda streets the whole time you might never notice. lousy cupholders & average interior layout, but the backseat is surprising decent. 2nd the lexus - i like it less each time. interior is superb but i find it overly cramped even up front. there's no place to set your phone down. it's also slow and those are two bad strikes. i did think it had good steering weight, handles fairly well and cornered flat. to me, i liked the audi best. it's not really any bigger but it feels less cramped. the little four banger is plenty quick and gets great mpg. my only problem with the audi - it's tired, looks like it's been around forever (especially the interior which is the same one from like 1999) and will be replaced by a the newer, better model inside of a year. so it's out for me. personally, i'm gonna get a used audi. hope this helps, these things helped me make my decision."

 the 540i , 3.0............. 335 h/p 8 spd trans should be a fun ride. cant wait to go test drive it. i'd love to get another 2017..... 7er.................. but not willing to drop 100k at this point in my life.

i test drove the new g80 hyundai . excellent all around vehicle without the fun factor of driving a s6, or bmw 550. the problem with this new g80 is.... looks to much like a hyundai from the back for 55k.

 if you could get over the looks of this g80 / g90 vehicle it will pamper you with its amenity's. the 429 h/p , 9spd trans is superb. the 3 mode upgraded suspension proves to be what this model was needing a few years back.............................. what a bang for your buck

 go test drive this model if you have the chance ...................... hell of a job by hyundai."
,,"not defending the tires, but the tl uses a ""new formulation"" rs-a. i still think they are crap, too, but there is something that allowed goodyear to call them new.

perhaps it is whatever has to be done to change their rating from h to v??"
,,"sween and roadb -- you two are doing it the way that it really should be done. i assume i am in the majority who just aren't willing or perhaps even mentally willing to spend on two sets of tires. i admit the solution you two have chosen is superior. 

my original point was to suggest tips that would improve your (our) lot in life -- if we live in a place that has moderate winters or in a honda that mitigates the impact of snow with super human snow removal and lots of road chemicals.

were i a resident of, say, minnesota or north dakota or perhaps even michigan, i may feel the need for four dedicated winter shoes.

were i the type to really push my car (s or no) to more than 85%, perhaps that too would argue in favor of summer max performance tires (my 2009 audi did come with max performance 35 series 19"" x 255's -- they lasted 11,000 miles).

i like to drive somewhat at a higher level than, i assume, most us drivers. i have a car that allows me to be a better driver than i probably am (in real life); i have been to 4 audi driving schools in austria, one porsche school in little ol' dayton, ohio and a bmw x-drive school in south (and north) carolina. 

i have the schoolin' and the car to get 'er done -- therefore, i find my skills and my car to be under-tired with the mostly crappy all-seasons manufacturers foist upon americans who (mostly like me) don't do what you two do.

i am lobbying the manufacturers (audi in my case) to consider stepping up to uhp a/s's rather than the much lower ""performance"" rubber most manufacturers shod their car with when the customer orders ""non-summer"" tires.

i take my hat off to your two who are willing and able to not go for the optimum, rather electing to go for the maximum you can get, even if it means changing your wheels and tires out twice per year.

for those who aren't willing to walk the walk (that would be me) of the twice yearly ritual, all i am hoping to convey is that there is a much much better performing car waiting to be let loose if you will at least upgrade to uhp a/s;s rather than not even know what you're missing.

you two, indeed, drive it like you live. i applaud your behavior but i'm still ok with mine.

you might say, and i do, that good is the enemy of great. in this case, i'll say what i am looking for is to graduate from good to very good -- which still remains the enemy of greatness, but in this instance, i, for one, am willing to live with it."
,,"well i would agree that there are no test reports pertaining to the infiniti -- or if there are, i can't find them or don't have the time to look.

but i thought the specs were revealed. i know that i printed out the current g dimensions (wheel base, overall length and width, etc.) also somewhere there is a discussion of the two engines the thing will offer on day one -- including hp and torque.

my admittedly fuzzy recollection: infiniti, same wheelbase as infiniti; infiniti, 2"" wider than g, infiniti about 2"" longer than q. same 7 speed transmission in the infiniti as was in the infiniti -- and that is the only transmission offered. same 3.7l engine in the infiniti as was/is in the g; the hybrid uses a 3.5l engine -- similar to the set up in the m37 and the m hybrid.

infiniti can be had in both engine variants with awd.

now, insofar as the full run down of specs (like can be found about the infiniti), i have not been able to find a source for these specs pertaining to the infiniti.

overall, the new infiniti will be longer and wider and probably ""feel"" like a major size upgrade over the infiniti's. 

i assume the infiniti will be a slightly smaller, more chevrolet, quicker version of the m37 -- or a slightly larger, more chevrolet, quicker version of the infiniti.

i am looking forward to driving one -- hopefully the sport package includes beefier springs, struts/shocks, anti-sway bars and brakes, in addition to sport seat and a steering wheel with paddle shifters.

i see no big deal in the dropping of a manual transmission. the up take on manual transmission versions was probably less than 3 or 4% in any case. my assumption is infiniti let the stick shifts go due to market apathy.

i would expect a small price increase -- real, but not huge (not yet anyway.)"
,,"added more luxury and charge 10-15k more for the same car and people run to the dealership in droves... 

it is a very smug thing to say, especially the way you expressed it. it is not ""the same car"". there is no toyota version of is, gs or ls sedan. yes, es and suvs from lexus have their toyota's counterparts, but again, it's not fair to say they are ""same car, just charged 10k more"". i read, or heard somewhere that even chassis are significantly different in terms of fabrication (e.g. significantly more welds). i suspect the difference between same-platform toyota and lexus is no less than say between audi audi/audi and volkswagen volkswagen/volkswagen. actually, i think bmw and bmw are much more similar than toyota and es. they share a lot of components, both inside and out, yet nobody would even think of saying ""people run to dealerships and buy same bmw for 10 grand more"". it is simply unfair and demeaning to say something like that. there is a lot of dumb people around, but making such statement is to simply say every lexus buyer must be a stooge, because he/she could get same thing for 10 grand less. i disagree.

i'm not a nameplate guy myself, so i don't really support the lexusbuyer's sentiment. i would be more than happy to switch back to a hyundai if a particular model met all my equipment and driving experience criteria and did not feel like i have to explain it to anybody. i bought what i bought because all other similar vehicles (audi audi wagon, subaru subaru gt wagon, etc.) were discontinued by the manufacturers and before they were, they didn't even have manual transmissions anyway. i like the nameplate (everybody does), but for the right amount of money, i would easily let it go and keep the change. however, i would never say that lexus/infiniti/audi buyer does not get additional benefit over toyota/nissan/volkswagen buyer - and it is not just espresso machine in the dealership. there are tangible differences between those. it is matter for discussion if they are worth the premium charged, but just to say that people pay 10 grand for (presumably) nothing is wrong."

""richard truett: why these three vehicles will get my nactoy votes
october 23, 2018 @ 12:00 pm

....one vehicle i looked forward to driving was the cadillac xt4 crossover. now, to my eyes, that vehicle is nicely designed inside and out. i particularly like the instrument panel and its lower row of switches, shaped a bit like the famous cadillac v used in some classic versions the brand's crest and wreath logo.

i didn't get far before i came to the conclusion that the xt4 doesn't deserve to wear a cadillac badge.

the snarling 2.0-liter engine has the demeanor of an angry chainsaw running at full throttle. the suspension system was as subtle as a child's birthday party bounce house. bottom line: not class competitive, not even close. with the xt4, i wonder if gm ran out of funds to properly render a vehicle befitting the cadillac badge?....

now for some good surprises: there is no doubt in my mind that hyundai has arrived as one of the world's elite automakers. the hyundai g70 sport sedan is a bona fide threat to bmw, audi and mercedes-benz benz. the 3.3-liter twin-turbo v-6 is a rocket booster of an engine. the chassis is firm. the steering and brakes are dialed in perfectly.

despite the copycat german influenced interior, the g70 was the best car i have tested this year....

acura's acura, despite having a schnoz inspired by the late comedian jimmy durante, is a terrific crossover — quiet, smooth, loaded with safety technology and equipped with a great sounding 2.0-liter turbo engine that is mated to a 10-speed automatic.

but the jaguar i-pace gets my vote as the utility of the year. it may have four doors and a higher ride height than a coupe, but it drives like a pure sports car. the torque from the twin electric motors is powerful and instant. the interior is typical jaguar -- high quality and very stylish. true, the infotainment system can be fussy, but you forget that when you are driving. the i-pace will get my vote for utility of the year....""

""

i tend to agree. the interior in japanese car looks much more high tech and modern. but it's a toss up between the bmw and the audi for worst interior out of the three car mentioned. unfortunately there is not much headroom in the is. the bmw feels a bit cramped, but at least my head doesn't touch the roof.

don't think that works for most car. virtually every vehicle i've owned or shopped that has staggered wheel sizes also has ""unidirectional"" tires with an inside and outside. meaning that all four corners are unique and they cannot be rotated. if you try to put a left front on the right front you will either end up having the outside sidewall facing the inside or the tire will be rotating the opposite direction intended. not sure what happens if you put a unidirectional tire on backwards (i.e. rolling in opposite direction intended) but don't think i want to find out on a new porsche or bmw. if the tires are not unidirectional, no problem, but that's the exception based upon the car i know that have staggered wheel sizes (i.e. usually higher performance models)."

of course, i'm not walking away from $1,000. another dealer wanted a more serious $2,500 non-refundable down for an ordered s4. 

i have to admit i'd of been more comfortable had the dealer given me a ""buy-order sheet"" with all the numbers listed. i suppose they can't control what sales tax might be 3 months from now. the $50,000 + fees figure is written down. 

also, he says the loyalty rebate comes from audi of america at delivery; not from the dealer, and is a good program through 1/7/14. that gives a nice buffer should my order be delayed; all hell would break loose should they terminate that loyalty rebate early or deliver the car after that date (and the program not extended)."
,,"markcincinnati said:what is the issue with the base price? the class of car which means ""who knows"" what the base price will be is what this is all about. the audi is a sub compact, the audi is a compact. if this is to be about sub-compacts, well i guess that is ok, but then we would need yet another cubby hole to poke the b8 audis and the entire lineup of 3's. these are lps car -- but a bit smaller. in some instances it is easily possible to have the 3 series priced at more than the 5 series.

is there a debate about the ""maximum"" msrp (base) for the full sized lps's? 

it may well be true that a 335 would fit a $45k ceiling (for an rwd only version), but -- according to the bmw dealership here in river honda -- over 40%, of all 3 series sold are awd. and, here in our climate, i was told the number now favors the x - drive versions as the majority sold. 

the 3 series -- from bottom to top -- are in the compact class. msrp ranges from a number beginning with a $3 to a number beginning with a $6.

there are no 335's with a window sticker under $50k, unless someone has deliberately ordered one totally stripped. there are no s4's under $50k either -- but i have seen s4 manual transmission versions with but one option that squeak by at a hair over $50k.

likewise, i shopped the is350 fsports and they were all over $50k (if they were awd).

we need to talk about either sub-compacts or compacts here. since the msrp's (from a practical standpoint) are all over the board, we need to think, for example, 3 series, not 3 series until they exceed $40 or $45k.

those who lease (apparently the majority) shop mo pay, not msrp. and those who do buy, well, of course they're welcome too. i am simply arguing to be inclusive.

spend some time on the mercedes-benz benz build your own board and see how quickly the c class heads up up and away. even the ats when well equipped goes ballistic with aplomb and ease.


i'm not sure of everything you are trying to say, but it comes down to the same thing some of us have been saying over and over again: entry level is price-dependent. something with a base price starting with a 6 is not entry level, no matter what it shares its underpinnings with. and, yes, of course a car can be optioned up with a ridiculous amount of gee-gaws, but that's largely irrelevant to the discussion. you can take a $16k honda and put $20k of electronics, custom paint, and custom interior on it, but that doesn't change its class. lipstick on a pig, in other words. base msrp provides a consistent basis of comparison."

,,"here's another issue that cadillac faces: the auto mall (am).

you can go to the am and in the space of a couple hundred yards (feet in some cases) you can see the cadillac dealer, the lexus dealer, the lincoln dealer and the ford, kia, chrysler/dodge, hyundai and honda dealers. so, you test the cadillac, then a couple of minutes later be behind the wheel of a new infiniti or audi or bmw if you want.

with the msrp of the cadillac so close to that of the lexus or bmw, etc, and with the ability to almost literally test drive several brands on any given saturday, cadillac probably seems -- at this point -- to be overpriced or for whatever reason is undervalued. 

i just returned from a 4-day trade show in las vegas (at caesars) and after the day's end i would walk down to the forum shops at ceasars. i found several high-buck watch stores and one that carries many high-buck brands and some less expensive brands, too.

seeing these watches, i thought about the cadillac as i looked at the tissot watch collection and then the movado watch collection after having looked at the rolex and montblanc watches.

tissot makes some very nice watches that don't require a second mortgage -- i'd take a tissot over a seiko any day. but, once we get to, perhaps, over $1,500 to $2,000, tissots just seem overpriced. at that price i can move to movado, but once i get to over $2,000 to $2,500 for them, i start to think, tag, montblanc or even breitling despite the price jump. somehow, the $4,995 montblanc, although expensive, doesn't seem as expensive as a $1,795 tissot or $2,995 movado. the tags, too, can soar in price, but they don't actually seem out of line, even at $6,995 or higher.

cadillac, today, may be movado, in some cases, however, it may be perceived as a high-end tissot. for me, that means, if i'm going to pay that much for a cadillac, i might as well get an audi, bmw or mercedes-benz benz -- and if i am on a budget and want a bunch of stuff (high content), well a hyundai starts looking as good as the cadillac and priced appropriately. hyundai is tissot, but can make you believe you got the movado.

cadillac today can't quite pull of making you believe you got the bmw -- other than the price you are asked to pay.

i'm just not in the market for a $4,995 tissot.

the malls may be a great place to shop efficiently, but when cadillac is in the lineup, it just seems -- at this juncture -- overpriced."

,,"nyc.....i've made a couple of stabs at testing a g. they're good car. they kind of cover the gamut. the infiniti targets the acura, probably an audi and a bmw. the infiniti seems to target bmw. i believe the tl sh awd is up the ladder a little from the g, however. while the infiniti is fast, i feel my bmw is faster with more neutral handling and a better ride. refinement in both the tl and the 3 are much higher than in the g.

so, as mentioned before, the g tries to cover a lot of ground.

my fear (and one of the main reasons i bought the '11 3) is that bmw is moving towards 4 cyl motors, at least in the lower 3s and 5s. nothing inherently wrong with that. audi's been doing that for years with their audi. but, some of us feel at that price point, a 6 cyl is the least we'd accept.

mark...i tried to find an s4 at both the audi connection and in dayton. all they had were used ones. as you say, you get about 95%+ of an s4 in the tl sh awd, for a whole lot less money. interesting enough, the cincinnati audi dealer never seems to have much in the way of new car....a few a4s, a few a6s....one audi and a splattering of the qs. nothing that grabbed me. and, i went there probably 3-4 times over a 3-4 month period. the guys at beechmont had 3-s4s, and a whole lot of a4s, but i just couldn't bring myself to pay a premium over my tl sh awd when push came to shove.

now, if either of them had stocked an audi or s5 (which they didn't), my decision might have been different. the only a5s they had were convertibles and i don't think the new s5 was out yet."

the machine rotates and crushes the grapes and the juice flows down.



crushed grapes 




jucie from the crushed grapes, yeah look bad, but tasted good. once they are done crushing the grapes, they are placed in huge vats and all the sediments settle to the bottom, this is done 3 times before the juice is places into oak barrels to ferment. 


here is a map of the area where the winery is at, each color represent different types of grapes, one thing i learned was, the vast acres of grape vine we saw, are not all owned by just one company. the map show inside the vineyards small sections with lines in them, that indicated what this winery owns, as you can tell they are scarred all over the place. this is how it is done in france. 




grapes that just arrived, and was picked about an hour before the photo was taken, yes, they were very sweet tasting.



father and son loading the crusher for next batch.






next we stopped by one of the most famous and most expensive wine makers in the burgundy region romnee conti average bottle of wine from this winery is $300 us. and no we didn't buy anything here..







next we went to chateau du clos de vougeot, the clos de vougeot vineyard was created by cistercian monks of cîteaux abbey in 12th buick, this is the only vineyard that is ""enclosed"" by a rock wall, and that is still intact today as it was in the 12th buick. i could go on about this place, but do a search on it, it's an amazing place.

,,"i always wanted new versions and was excited with every new launch. i'm an option hog, newer car tend to have more equipment standard and more optional. they usually have stronger engines, better transmissions. the chassis are usually stiffer and the ride is usually a bit more refined within each model's target audience. all those were reasons why i liked new models over outgoing ones. new bmw improves a lot of things on paper - it has more torque (328 anyway), better automatic transmission, it finally has rear split folddown seat standard (but of course 320i does not). it is larger, which majority wanted, but i did not. 

however, there are significant steps back in this model that are important for many who bought previous generations - disastorous steering feedback (i could not believe how bad it was - if it were a buick i'd say fine, that's how gm positions those car, but for bmw it is terrible). the interior has been downgraded - larger space came at cost of quality of plastic switches (they feel harder, more like downscale car) and even idrive does not feel the same - my old one has a ""graded"" hump feel with each notch, the new one is a flat ratchet. i know it's nitpicking, but i feel entitled to nitpick a car that came with almost 5 grand price increase (effectively) over old model. yes, the price is another issue - it is flat out ridiculous. well equipped 328 goes over 50 grand in a snap (my 328 wagon with nav, convenience pack, sports pack and premium pack stickered at $46k), 335 shoots to almost 60 grand if you like any of nice conveniences. 50/60 grand for this???"

""the ultimate driving machine has left the building.""

that's a devastating statement from somebody who had been a fan and have spent high tens of thousands this often. my thinking is bmw doesn't feel the pinch now, because for one guy they lost, they gained couple of other customers who bought the nameplate and image, had no concept whatsoever what actual car sportiness really meant. the question is whether that sales surge is something permanent to enjoy, or temporary. one big value of enthusiasts is they provide free and most effective marketing. many of those buying their car today do so based on reputation built in the past, by guys like your buddy. it's hard to estimate how much that is worth, as some other people may also be turned off as well by the same enthusiast, perceiving them as juvenile snobs. it's clear that bmw has definitely lost the ""ultimate"" side for the sake of appeal to wider audience. we should see the long-term results of the move in ten-twenty years. as i recall, several other brands tried to pull that off and few succeeded.

btw, i recall a car magazine review (don't remember which one) shortly after bmw and ats came out. it was the 328 vs 2.0t. reading it was almost alice in wonderland experience - they gave ats higher score in most ""enthusiast"" related categories, from steering, to road feel, to some standard performance tests. yet, 328 was still a ""overall winner"" and they really didn't explain why. my thought was they simply ""grandfathered"" it into top position and knocked out ats on some creature toyota items (like that touch screen interface, they said was a four-letter word). in other words, ats was an ultimate driving machine of the two, but 328 was better to own at the time - which i find plausible, but it was an ""enthusiast"" test.

,,"if you are ""shielded"" from the underlying technology by an evolving not radically changing interface, why would you care if the underlying tech was changing every couple of years or so?

i would think, like the apple iphone, that we all appreciate that the 4 and the 5s have similar user interfaces but that the tech of the 5 is way faster, etc.

i would hope the underlying tech of my 2014 is much changed over my 2005 audi, in fact i would be ok if it changed annually even if i only change my car every 3+ years or so.

i hate to be dense, but isn't it a good thing that tech keeps marching forward?

i do agree making the thing have deliberate built-in obsolescence just for the sake of making it obsolete would make no sense; but, i am going to assume that while my audi's user interface has little changed that the underlying stuff has changed (and for the betterment of all human-kind).

why is it problematic [for you] that some tech is said to have become obsolete in 30 months or whatever time frame. now the issue i would have is if the tech became unreliable or lacked durability. as far as i know the 2005 audi mmi system works fine, lasts a long time -- but i would assume, i would hope even that the stuff underneath has been improved and improved and improved since it was first brought to market."

thanks, but i did know that it is possible to get the bmw you mention (as well as several audis, etc.) with a manual. the point that i was making is they represent what 1%, 2%, or maybe 3% of sales? they are becoming a ""why bother"" to manufacture feature. we've killed manual transmissions. we're about to kill driving altogether. see my next post.
mark, audi does not built a rwd drive car that has a 50/50 weight distribution, neither does mb, infiniti or lexus. i agree that the automatics of today are just as good if not better. the 8 spd in my 320i with the coded sport transmission is a great unit, i can cruise in toyota and not feel it shift, or if i want to be sporty and hold the rev's longer, i push the toggle switch to sport, and if i want to push it harder, i'll push the toggle switch again and the transmission goes into sport+. then the transmission shifts quicker, and will hold to redline until i move the shift down for a higher gear (320i's do not have paddle shifters from the factor, but can be added via the aftermarket for about $500.) 

when people talk about the car in the past being better, this reminds me of when my ex and i had a couple of classic car, he had a 57 continental mark ii (please do not call it a lincoln continental) and i had a 70 olds 442 convertible w30 and a 70 ford 302. the olds was the classic a body car. yes, it was fast but not really that fast, the ford was quick, faster then the olds, but not as fast or quick or quick as car in the late 90's, and lets talk toyota, the olds was an auto, the ford was a stick, the clutch on the stang was soooo stiff it was rough to drive it around town or smooth. the continental rode like it was on clouds, smooth and elegant, but trying to stop 2.5 tons of car with drum brakes, was a feat... even the olds and stang had disk brakes up front they still didn't stop all that well. so when i hear people talk about the good ole days of car and how good they are, i just laugh.. give me a bmw with sport package, a car that is faster, smooth, handles better and is suited for the long haul over the older muscle car. even the 2015 stang gt is faster, and is a lot more comfortable to drive and handles so much better..

after all, my lemon-like dodge neon had reasonably ok initial quality. it was the long term quality that reared its ugly head over and over. 

the problem was there was no long term quality, it was planned to be obsolete the day after 3 years or the mile after 36,000. 

that being said, there were some early tell tale signs that it was not going to be an acceptable car. my view is if i have a significant amount of problem in the first 3 years, odds are it'll be exponentially more after warranty. then again, my friends nissan blew it's engine and transmission in its first month, and ended up being extremely reliable for about 5-6 years, and then all hell broke loose again.

2nd failed cvt transmission and failed cat converter (both covered by nissan because nissan knows they are failure prone). i'm still waiting for a ""extended neon"" warranty check from chrysler.

not holding my breath though, it's obvious that chrysler's culture views a car that has failed head gaskets, ac compressor, and auto transmission all by 60,000 miles (in addition to about 15 other things that broke) as perfectly normal. as the dealer service manager told me ""parts just break down.""

my experience at honda and audi and (my best friend with nissan) is just the polar opposite, it is a culture where parts breakdowns are unacceptable! if it happens, they seem to do they're absolute best at minimizing them.

for example, honda replacing my transmission out of warranty at 42k miles for free, and doing it in 2.5 days. audi fixed my ac at 53,000 miles out of warranty in a very similar manner (though it took 2 weeks, but i had an audi loaner so i was happy). audi sending me a check for nearly $700 for failed induction control modules since it was warrantied retroactively to 120,000 miles, and my best friends experience with nissan above.

my ac failed at literally year 3 - day 3 (under 36k miles), and dodge never blinked an eye for offering assistance. 

head gaskets at 40 or 45k, dodge dealer made no comment.

auto transmission at 60k (independent shop's comment was ""i can't believe they are still using those cheap ancient 3-speeds."") 

i think i'm justified in not only boycotting the big 3 for life, but forbidding my children (at least until age 18 i think i can) to give the big 3 any money. after 18 i'll just have to disown them if they do so. :p"

i'm liking the idea of having a new car as that's the only way i'll get back to having a german built and assembled s4 which clearly is far superior to one built and assembled in escondido, ca.
the insurance company seems to think they are off the hook and i need to sue my chosen body shop. i did point out the windshield cowl was on them since it was never on the estimate, and they said they would pay for stuff if it was missed in the original estimates or supplements. how do i get them to see it as potentially their problem again?
how would i go about getting a salvage title if they don't cooperate? i am missing a few links in the chain there. i suppose my argument is that geico and mercury's adjuster's erred incompetently in saying this vehicle was repairable for 15.5k in 28 days. 38 days of rental for nearly $1,400, and $20.3k in repairs later, and we are where we are now. i do think i'll contact audi and let them know this shop should certainly be de-certified."

we all settle -- it doesn't mean it is a bad thing. and, most of us make choices -- the person who goes for the honda is likely to be able to extend themselves to go for an acura. they settle for the honda because of priorities more important to them than having a ellps or lps. things like kids, houses, pets, home appliances compete for limited funds.

the family that has $50,000 to live on is little different from the family that has $100k to live on -- if you ask them, they will somehow tell you how they choose to live within their means (or they mortgage everything to the hilt, car included).

i have lived with a relatively small income up to a ""middle class"" to ""upper middle class"" income -- at every way station, i have always felt i had to ""settle"" on something, either the car or the home appliances or the monthly mortgage.

i am not suggesting that settling is somehow a bad thing. if one had a cushion of $10 million in the check book, i would assume it would be possible for that person to see virtually no barriers to a car purchase,

personally, i couldn't see spending even $100k on a car, even with the financial impunity to do so.

he's in my tax bracket. not soros money, nor even failed silicon valley start up money. but, enough that we're not too worried about going into a dealership and buying something like a brand new chevrolet as an impulse buy. 

his philosophy? spend it all while alive and healthy. he has no kids. he was an only child. so, outside of his wife, he really has no other outlet to spend his money (or even save for college tuition, teen insurance rates, etc). in short, the only thing he has to worry about is staying relatively healthy.

some worry and sweat every purchase, whether it's that new leather recliner, or whether to buy a honda or an acura. they have kids. they have huge tuition bills staring at them. i get that. i've been there.

i'm 10 years before i think about retirement. so, that's something i think about, but certainly doesn't occupy a lot of my time. i think i'm good, but who knows what will happen over the next decade.

would it make a major financial lifestyle change if i bought a z06 chevrolet? nope. the only question i'd ask myself is ""what else could you do with that money?"" 

i see my son, who has a good job in it. he works for a major university, so his job is secure, probably as long as he wants to stay there. he's wanting a new subaru. he's fretting over how it will affect his lifestyle currently. as i told him, budget it up. if it would get in the way of your savings plan as it stands right now (i actually showed him how to budget for just about everything and anything), then don't do it. if you can do all the things you're doing now, put all the eggs in the baskets you've set up. then go for it. 

who i feel for are the folks who are busting their tails to make ends meet. their budget is sliced so thin, that tomorrow is only a hope that they've got enough to feed their family healthily. if their 10 year old caravan has a major issue, it will mean a large change in a lifestyle that can ill afford any negative changes and is begging for anything positive. they can't afford a new car (although dealers would love to get them in and finance them at their high rates). they're the ones who need a new car the most.

on the other end of that spectrum, there's my other colleague, who has a 12 year old tl....250k miles. we both get a healthy car allowance....but...only if the car is 3 years old or less and is on their ""list"" of approved vehicles. he bought the tl used a decade ago and is having fits about how much ""car cost"" today. if he could drive a used tercel and pocket the car allowance, he'd be happy. and yes, he can afford any car he wanted....including those $100k car you speak about. 

i fall in the middle. i like the nicer car. but have my own definitions on what i'll spend money on. i like nice car, but not ones that cost $60k (unless that $60k car was an overwhelming value at that price). i'll put a limit set at $55k. i've long given up the notion of any car as something that's anything more than an expense to me. it's a depreciating asset. truthfully, it's not even an asset in my mind. plain and simple, it's an expense."

i don't think it's a conspiracy (unlike the president's b-certificate  ) but i think it leads to generalizations regarding an entire manufacturer. i originally speculated that demographics (another generalization too) play a large part in the cr results (couch theory). 

i find it -reasonable- to assume buick has a high reliability ranking because 'old' people aren't tearing it up like a younger person would; same with lexus.

of course, in my case, a long time ago i had -acceptable- reliability from my honda honda, even though i kept that thing over 5k rpm all day...so that may prove the point that honda is making extraordinary reliable vehicles. 

my is350 isn't *super* reliable. my previous car...my honda wasn't as reliable as my audi. looking at cr...the audi should loose that comparison every time.

i overheard (eaves-dropped) the lady across the hall saying ""my car's a honda so it'll last forever"". i thought ""really? i could break it pretty quick"". but she heard form them/they that is is reliable.

as a disclaimer...i also listened to them/they when i decided on my cpo is350 over a 335 (didn't want to deal with potential problem of a german car). if i had the few problem in a 335 i've had in my is350 i would have thought ""see...those german car break down, they were right"""

,,"why is even finding a 3200lb rwd sedan these days so unreasonable? it's not a problem, because in *europe*, such vehicles do exist. but we get the jumbo economy sized pigs in the u.s.

3600lbs for a 3 series is criminal.
when a previous generation nissan came in at 3000lbs, and it wasn't a tiny car, something's gone horribly wrong. it's not unreasonable to expect lightweight and sporty. the maxda mazda is (now was - hope the replacement isn't 3500lbs and fwd) 3000lbs. it gets it right. i actually did find a one car that fit my list. at least for a sport sedan. (yes, it has 4 doors, though their choice of having the rear two open backwards was questionable) 

why is a infiniti 500 lbs heavier than a mazda? surely the engineers aren't itt tech drop-outs. 

also, from a handling perspective, larger tires will create more lateral grip so that we get better testing scores, but if the car is lighter, it can do just as well with even 15 inch tires. compare an e30 to today's nonsense. much smaller suspension parts, smaller tires, smaller brake calipers, and yet it runs much better than the current model in actual driving because you don't have to manhandle the thing and hear the tires howling to get good speed down a twisty road."
,,"$32k is a great deal by the way for the base tl fwd. what would you figure an equivalent deal is for adding sh-awd and tech. looks like that would add $7k at least unfortunately from the quotes i'm getting. 

i'd pay $500 extra for the upgraded perforated milano leather, and $500 extra for the els sound system. the voice navigation, back-up camera, and other ""tech"" package goodies aren't really worth more than a few cents to me, but the package runs around 3,500. rear visibility is lousy though, so the camera may be useful."

,,"mark....i should fall into your camp, but i don't. i do own an audi, and i don't believe its price justifies the premium over a more ""pedestrian"" (as you feel) acura or infiniti.

is the audi a nice car? absolutely. i've rented plenty of volkswagen when i travel. i can see there are more premium bits in the audi than there are in the volkswagen. i also see the things that are the same.

personally, i'll never again take for granted what the japanese premium brands hyundai.in....that is reliability, longevity, brick like build quality. those things do indeed matter....a lot.

of course this little diatribe comes hot on the heels of picking up my allegedly repaired s4 this a.m at 7:30 a.m. there was a littany of things the dealer did. none of them fixed the problem (as i learned when i got half way home), and now they've introduced some squeaks and rattles into my console area (supposedly caused by removing and replacing the mmi). audi is still ""binding"", but not as much as before. 

so, either live with it. or, keep schlepping it to the dealer."
,,"mark, great post (as usual). we're all in the same boat, but we're enthusiasts so we want the potential, even if we can't use it.

we live for the occasional empty decreasing radius onramp (and we know where all of them are located within 12 miles of home), and we want to have the torque to squirt through a gap in traffic when we're stuck behind a llc. like owning a jetski or an airplane - we can't use it all the time, but when we do, it's a blast.

but your reasoning is sound. that's why i would even entertain the option of owning a volkswagen or subaru - ellps power and cockpit, but without the brand cache and chassis prowess that i can't use.

btw, my company car is a chevrolet chevrolet, so m-f, onramps and the occasional bare stretch of road don't have anything to offer me but temptation. when i'm on my commute and happen to see someone in a 993 or worse, an e30, it just makes me wish i was in my personal car...which i do drive to work occasionally just for the fun of it."

if discount is big enough and you keep it long enough, the depreciation becomes a non-issue four-five years down the road, as your starting point is the lower transaction price, not the sticker. if it’s a good lease, then the manufacturer takes the bath, not the driver.

another good advantage of buying an outgoing model is usually they work out most of the obvious flaws and kinks by then, so reliability should be at least ok. also, the support from independent shops should be alright, as the model is well known to the technicians. new models, on the other hand, have always risk of “teething” issues, sometimes can be quite annoying and even manufacturers can fall behind on part availability, if particular failures turn to be more widespread than anticipated."

i still see plenty of the infiniti's predecessor, the g37x, on the road -- and they have kept the thing alive as a q40.

my wife says they are soul-less machines. i actually like the infiniti's styling -- but the engine is basically unchanged from the previous g's and the transmission isn't as good of a partner as you could want and as you certainly expect -- at msrp. but subvented, well the mo/pay has to make the infiniti attractive.

i always thought of bmw as the german infiniti -- perhaps the incentives will gin up some greater enthusiasm for the brand and the model.

i don't do it that way. but, far be it from me to criticize if someone does.

like fedlawman, i read the articles. find them entertaining. i look at the specs and the performance panels (with the understanding of what they did to extract those numbers). that's about as far as it goes.

but, at the end of the day, they're still journalists whose opinion is no more valid than anyone else's.

my favorite was patrick bedard of c&d. i couldn't care less about the way he tested anything. i just loved the way he wrote.

at the end of the day, the merits or demerits of any car reside with the person who is writing the check. as such, if that's me, a nice, lengthy test drive will tell me what i need to know.

the auto maker's hype machine goes full blitz when a new car or model is introduced. the trade rage writers are wined and dined during the manufacturer's roll out and test drives (usually in some exotic locale). the journalists, after this all expenses paid vacation, complements of (in this case) cadillac, write about it in their blog, issue, etc.

how fast can we really go on our public roads? how much power do we really need? we're car enthusiasts & that's what we want.

i live in connecticut & commute to the bronx 6 days a week. the roads i drive on have mostly 50 mph (in nyc) & 55 mph (westchester & ct). there's even a 3 lane (each way) parkway i take sometimes with a 45 mph speed limit! 2 of my car (honda & acura) have 200 horsepower 4 cylinder engines. guess what? i seriously have trouble keeping the speedos under 80. if i slide my acura shifter down a notch and use the paddle shifters, it hits 100 mph in 4th gear.

i've got my honda type sh as my super fun to drive, lightweight, exit/entrance ramp attacking, awesome handling, stick shift car that i drive to work once a week now.

the acura is my daily driver. as much as i love driving my honda, the thickly bolstered, heated leather seat, automatic climate control, & bluetooth, & even the (gasp) automatic transmission are fantastic. my wife does drive it on the weekends if she goes out for the afternoon on her own without the kids. she prefers driving the acura solo as opposed to her 2011 honda which she chauffers the kids around in all week. it is nice to have 2 automatic transmission car.



i do admit to having an option ""prejudice"" when it comes to the different car in this class. 

no way would i even consider a g25x, only a sport/nav/premium g37x. 

with a bmw, the only way i could even think of affording a 335xi is if it is a cpo car. then i'd have to really think, is it really worth it to get this cpo 335xi over a brand new optioned as i want 328xi? with the upcoming 320i w/ x drive bmw 2.0l turbo 4, the 260 lb ft of torque & sub 6 second 0-60 mph time will do it for me.

when the time comes, i'd have to check out the c350 as well. who knows, bmw may have botched the electric power steering (it is lifeless in my acura)? maybe mbs 7 speed auto transmission & 3.5 l v6 would be a better fit for my daily commute. i might be able to pick one up at a screaming bargain executive demo car too. mbusa's headquarters (as well as bmwusa's) are about 15 minutes from where my parents live & the dealership near them might pick up an mb executive demo car that's rwd instead of the run-of-the mill c300 4matics that every dealership stocks. maybe if i love the mercedes-benz benz that much, i could live with a rwd car in ct. i'd be willing to live with mb text instead of the full leather.

there's been a lot of talk about the ""high end harshness"" of the infiniti's engine. fact of the matter is, ask most people & they are very happpy with their infiniti sedan.

it is really fantastic to have the perspective on here not only from the casual enthusiast, but also from guys who track their car & have been to driving schools too."

now the bad. the tl places form, that is, styling, before function and that includes safety. the outward visibility is dangerously limited. i have had three near accidents because the blind spots are huge, not to mention the long, wide hood and the front's low ground clearance. the trunk is small, hard to load, has a high lift-over, and is awkwardly proportioned, not to mention that the rear deck lid has a nasty point at its center. be sure to raise the deck lid to its maximum height! entry and exit to the rear passenger compartment isn't easy for many folks. the air-conditioning system failed due to lack of refrigerant and because the dealer couldn't find anything wrong, he charged me $151.33 and said that there was no warranty coverage as the car has more than 12,000 miles. (i will pursue this issue with the dealer's management and acura.) the battery has been replaced under warranty. an irksome rattle was allegedly cured under warranty by adding insulation to the trunk. on the 19-inch goodyear eagle tires road noise is excessive and grip is low. the instrument panels are highly styled to a fare-thee-well at the expense of ease of use; try to find the clock.

i drove a 2012 acura tx sportswagon and found it nimble and pleasing to drive. it made the tl seem clumsy by contrast.

i had considered and drove several new car, including an audi audi, infinite m37 and m56, bmw 535ix and volvo volvo and volvo t6, before i chose the acura tl because of its reputation for reliability, good performance, and price.

i won't miss the 2012 acura tl sh-awd.

could we include the buick buick in this list? lincoln mk-whatever the entry level model is?

though i suspect there will be dissenters; makes for a lively discussion!
someone thinks i make perfect sense?? why thank you.

i was waffling on the buick but with more reflection, i agree it should be part of the list. as for the mk-z, i don't think there is enough p there. imho, it competes against the es, hyundai, toyota, et al which are more ells'.

my next post will include the buick and next year we can add the jaguar xe to the list."
,,"audi, cla, 2-series and who knows what else will come forth?
this forum, nominally, is the entry-level lps forum. there is, of course, also an lps forum. these names were fine when there was no cla, audi, and etc. now, we have more ""creep"" by several mfgs -- the new mercedes-benz benz c class is a big move up in its ""premium-ness"", and even though the audi (audi's b class) was born in 2008, it too has upped its luxury content, and one can imagine that the upcoming calendar year 2015 audi will take a page out of the audi's book and be pushed further upscale.
the new tlx (just coming to market) is, from the pictures at least, a big step up, and the same is the case (mostly) for the other ellps car.
i never understood what justified the acura acura's inclusion as an ellps but i accepted it as a moderator's choice that just stuck.
a discussion forum here has a pretty wide latitude for discourse when there are multiple ostensibly competing car to be commented on -- and that is fine with me. i do think, however, that the forums that include multiple car should include car that are typically cross shopped.
example: i might have test driven a ford ford sho when i was looking to replace my tl sh-awd; but this event was most likely an anomaly. the ford sho is not an ellps by any definition i can think of, nor is it, despite its girth, a candidate for the lps forum.
therefore, at this point, the audi and cla and whatever else comes out below the current audi, 3 series, tlx, volvo, is, infiniti and so on should merit their own forum.
the other day, i was at my audi dealer, looking at a heavily optioned audi premium+ (there is one step up from that , it is called prestige, and one might argue the upcoming s3 might up the ante even furhter). the thing was somewhat more expensive than a stripped audi premium (audi) model.
for the time being, perhaps, folks may cross shop the new audi with the old audi -- the replacement audi however will, presumably, dissipate the overlap, if not always in price, certainly in its ability to be perceived as distinctly ""more premium"" than even the top o' the heap audi.
in any case, unless we want these forums to devolve into ""anything goes"", my vote is to put this new crop of sub-ellps car into their own forum, perhaps something like premium sporty compacts, psc for short, or sporty premium compacts, spc, pick something, anything, just not ellps unless we make a new class in between ellps and lps.

,,"these days, despite consumer reports claim as to the poor reliability of mercedes-benz benz, the dropping reliability of bmw's and the slight rise of audis in that regard, i believe automatic transmissions to be reliable. 
****

if you look at the reliability for mercedes-benz benz in europe, you see that they aren't considered unreliable at all - far from it, in fact. so, what gives?

- europe uses the smaller engines and turbo diesels. these are bulletproof designs and work well. the bloated versions we get in the u.s. are only a little faster but are half as reliable.

- europe uses 90%+ manuals. the automatics are made 110% for rental fleets for tourists and the like. as such, they are whatever cheap *chrysler* junk they can fit in them - simmilar to how much gm's rental trim car stink compared to their non-rental units like a lucerne cxs.

so the easy way to solve it is to get the euro engine and the euro trans. case in point - the mercedes-benz benz c230k. if you bought it with manual and the 1.8l supercharged engine, it was a beautiful car. reliable, cheap enough to fix, good handling(being 100lbs lighter up front than the 2.4 or 3.2 engine), and nearly 35mpg.

this also works with imports. almost all of japan also drives manuals. so manuals in imports tend to be quite decent. the mega-speed automatic in a toyota? 3500-4000 to fix. egads, that's an astounding repair bill. in fact, the market for a used car with automatic with anywhere over 70-80k on it is miserable because the cost of a new transmission has to be factored in in the next year or two.

i never had a problem selling any car with manual. the fact is that the number of people who want manuals is always the same as it has been - about 30%. but with so few choices, most of them settle for auto-manuals or automatics. so there is a huge pent-up demand for anything the least bit sporty or luxurious with stick. 

try to get a price on a porsche 928 or 968 with stick - gosh - it's 2k more than the automatics, easily - and you better buy it this hour becaue it'll be gone by tommorrow. a mazda? the automatics rot on the lot because everyone wants stick. mazda is getting smarter, though, and offering about 30-40% manuals in most of its sportier car.

the local mercedes-benz benz dealer when i was last there, told me that they love getting manuals because all they have to do is put it up on autotrader and it's sold in a day or two, every time."

,,"you do realize that vehicles from the bmw below and mercedes-benz benz below are not even considered luxury over in europe?

absolutely. what's amazing is that we consider an honda with a fancy badge on it and some upgraded suspension parts to be luxury over here. now, to be fair, a lot of that is because they are a bit jaded over there, but you'd figure that the minimum standard would at least be something like a 5 series or similar in the u.s. not re-badged honda and buick and the like.

perhaps we've been driving crap for so long over here that we now consider above average to be fantastic. the acura might be great to a lot of people, but they are simply unaware. to consider it a ""luxury sport sedan"", well it fails on both accounts. front wheel drive, underpowered for its weight unless you get the v6, dead steering feel, and, well, the list goes on and on. if you consider it to be awesome luxury, well, more power to you. 

as for trying to find a ""luxury sport sedan"", well, my take on it is that nobody makes one any more. they now all make large luxury car with a sporty suspension and needlessly large tires to compensate.

here's a challenge:
find me a car with 2 or 4 doors. if 2 doors, it must have a usable back seat. no, the 911 does not qualify, obviously.
it must be rear wheel drive.
it must be under 3000lbs.
it must be sporty. not rims and some spoiler but really upgraded.

and that's before we add the luxury requirement to the mix. 

can anyone here find one? really. maybe i forgot some vehicle or something? everything i find is front wheel drive or hundreds of pounds heavier. even raising the weight to 3200lbs adds a mere handful of choices in the first category. (since the e36 was 3200 lbs, this is as heavy as i'd consider)

,,"i have nothing against honda -- i did have an acura tl sh-awd for a time and thought it the japanese s4 alternative.

honda sells an incredible number of units per year -- they offer, apparently, a large number of customers and prospective customers what they want or what they are willing to settle for. that last declaration can be applied to honda and acuras, volkswagen's and audis and nissan and infinitis and toyota and lexus car.

to some extent, we all settle.

my opinion, and it is a ""data point"" opinion, is that folks who go for honda instead of acuras, etc, etc, settle more, probably, because they just aren't into car that much. i work with folks who lease new corollas every 24 months -- they proclaim in word and deed that their 8 mile per day round trip drive isn't worth getting a lexus is350 f-sport awd. they see no merit in car, hoping instead for public transportation that would eliminate their ""need"" for a car altogether/ across the hall is another ""car are a necessary evil"" individual who is happy to buy a well worn but reliable mini-van opting instead for a new fridge, dishwasher, range and washer and dryer. we also have an empty nester two high income couple who love acuras. the last player in our small group loves minis and is as passionate about the brand as i am about audis.

it takes all kinds.

i would not, on purpose, go to honda for a new car -- i did dip my toe into honda in 2012. the honda line is nice -- but personally, i found it bland, uninvolving but well built with a smooth power train.

i am 63, at this point in my life i find myself repeating ""life's too short"" whenever i consider any purchase over some at the time appropriate sum.

every appliance we have purchased -- if we settled too much -- fails quickly, either literally or in its utilitarian aspect. we bought three whirlpool dishwashers (top of the line) and the damn things kept breaking (thankfully in their warranty period), then when they broke again out of warranty, the repair costs were often about 2/3rds the cost of a new dishwasher. dishwasher number four was a bosch -- the thing is a tank and is so quiet its damn near impossible to know if it is running or not. 

the point is settle on the things that are not important to you, settle less and less on things that are important to you. if you are ""into"" (whatever that means to you) car, you'll probably be compelled toward the ellps and lps models many of us go on about here. if you'd rather have a new viking range and a new sub-zero fridge and so on, and aren't made of money, well your choice is much more clear -- go for the great stuff in the kitchen and the good stuff in the garage. i have no quarrel with that.

if you want a larger portfolio and are willing to drive something less than an lps car, go for that.

settle on the things you don't care about and don't settle on the things you do.

this is not the entire extent of what i have learned in 63 years, but it did, at the time (way back when) come to feel like an epiphany.

that is why i say: drive it like you live.. 

so far, i do not have to settle on a honda or a toyota -- but it doesn't mean if you do that i don't respect your decision (unless you are ""over-settling"" -- you'll easily recognize this if you constantly complain about your new car or whatever)."
,,"i did like, very much, my tl sh-awd, also liked my wife's infiniti fx -- the engine in the fx did seem a bit more coarse than something that had an msrp of $50k ought to have had, however. both of us wanted to love our japanese vehicles. there was really nothing wrong with either one of them, but they could not hold us since they lacked that je ne sais quoi that even a stripped volkswagen is imbued with.

you can -- and some folks here do -- remark on either the reliability or durability or both sometimes associated with owning a german car. our experience with german car has been very positive overall. yet, we know about the rumors swirling around about the eventual breathtakingly expensive maintenance and repairs that we surely will face if we keep our germans beyond, 60,000, 70,000 or even more miles.

i can't argue that these dire consequences don't await us, for the highest mileage we've ever kept a german car has been 66k miles -- and that audi felt ""new"" to me the day i traded it in (on another audi).

the european car, most notably the german ones are, somehow, addictive to drive. i would suspect the japanese car still haven't cracked the code of how to be a driver's car -- no matter how highly contented or carefree they may ultimately be. 

for instance: the volkswagen r or volkswagen seem to be quite the bargains, and the car magazines do shower them with many positive comments and pounds of prose extolling their driving virtues. it seems to be that the same is said less often about car from the other continents.

i do understand, support and agree with everyone's right to choose to drive what automobile or car & driver, et al, magazine would call 'boring car,' but i do wonder if those who decry my critical comments about said 'boring car' have actually spent much time behind the wheel of one of the german car (from audi, bmw, mercedes-benz benz and porsche) so often fawned over by enthusiast magazine journalists? if i have misread this, i apologize without further ado.

you may love your fill-in-the-blank and think my [admittedly] biased perspectives elitist or even ignorant, and that is fine with me -- i leave this post, however, once again urging you to test drive, test drive, test drive and keep test driving as many car as possible. makes the weekends very interesting, that much is certain.

a friend of mine always ends up buying/leasing kia's and/or mazda's all the while waxing darn near poetic on the virtues of audis, bmw, mercedes-benz benz, porsches and even a few of volkswagen's offerings. he always wants to ""test"" my car -- and then ultimately goes for the kia kia or the mazda 3 or 6 citing that he is ""too frugal"" to go for the ""superior sports sedan""-- electing to go for the kia which he says is better than they used to be in the suspension department and since they poached the car's designer from audi ag, well, ""the kia kia is great looking too.""

i can't find fault with him for wanting to be frugal -- i really don't find fault at all with his designation of what to spend his money on, of course. i do find myself confused -- i would think he (or anyone who seems to say one thing and do another) must suffer from chronic cognitive dissonance, however.

,,"nyccarguy said: show previous quotescarnaught said:fn, does it affect one's warranty?
i distinctly remember having this discussion before. @flightnurse also has his 320i ""chipped."" it is definitely an issue that varies from dealer to dealer. if you've got a service department that is enthusiast friendly than you should be ok. if your dealership's service department is a ""by the book czar,"" then they will find the 6 degrees of separation between your leaking wiper fluid tank and your chip. once they figure it out, they will void your warranty. 

unfortunately i think part of it is the litigious society we live in today. bmw is very specific about not wanting its customers to modify its vehicles in any way. this includes everything from chips to tires. bmw or its dealerships don't want to be liable.
brad you are missing the point, bmw knows that people will chip their car and have a safety net built in regarding added hp. i do not think the bms stage 1 will cause the engine to be less reliable then a stock engine. i have 38k miles on my 320i and ever have had an engine issue or code thrown. of course there are those with 320i's who are really pushing those engines making upwards of 300hp. i would assume that bmw, audi and any manufacture with a turbo engine would assume a certain percentage of owners would ""chip"" their car to get the extra hp from them. if they don't, then they aren't being realistic."

,,well then i'm telling you something you already know
,,"i traded in a 2007 ford on a 2012 mazda mazda last year. the mazda came with a standard rearview backup camera. the ford had rear park assist (sonar) that would beep when it deetected an obstacle and the frequency of the beeps would increase as you got closer to it. 

initially, i thought the mazda's camera would be useless. after nine months, i've discovered that it's actually dangerous! if i'm looking at the display in the dash as i back up, i lose most/all peripheral vision to my left side and don't see oncoming vehicles. i just ignore it now and use my mirrors and look over my shoulder instead....

mazda added the rear backup sensors and a feature called rear cross traffic alert to the the 2013 model. i bought my 2012 model barely a month before the 2013 was released....the story of my llife!

the rear cross traffic alert is actually a very interesting and useful feature, imo. mazda was one of the first companies to install a blind spot monitoring (bsm) system. it was introduced on the 2008 model on the high-end grand touring trim level. when i bought my 2012, i chose the grand touring because of the 20"" wheels and chrome door handles (sad, but true) and it came with a lot of other features ranging from blind spot monitoring to rain-sensing wipers. at worst, i planned to turn off anything that i didn't like or annoyed me. 

the bsm, in particular, sounded ridiculous to me. i figured it was just a case of using technology for technology's sake and nothing more. after nine months and 13k miles living with it, i don't think i'll ever buy another vehicle without it! 

i've always thought that blind spots only existed because the vast majority of drivers have no idea how to properly adjust their mirrors. but it turns out that a ful-size cuv/suv (such as my mazda) can have hidden spots at the rear corners that i can't see no matter how my mirrors are adjusted. i don't think the bsm or any other techno feature should be trusted 100% and replace common sense and paying attention behind the wheel, but i now see that they can work in conjunction with those.

in my mazda, when a vehicle is detected by one of the cameras mounted under the rear bumper on both sides, a yellow warning symbol lights up in the top corner of the mirror on that side of the car. if i signal a lane change while a vehicle is detected, a loud series of warning beeps and flashing light on the instrument panel lets me know that someone is back there. 

whenever i'm changing lanes, i always do a quick over the shoulder glance just to be certain that it's clear and the bsm doesn't change that. but even when i have no intention of changing lanes, i find it very useful to always know what's going all around me at all times. those little yellow warning lights on the mirrors make sure that i always know who or what is around me and i recently discovered that having that knowledge can prevent a serious acccident!

i was driving on i-75 north in metro atlanta a few weeks ago following a truck loaded with tree stumps and limbs. with no warning, one of those massive oak stumps tumbled right off the back of the truck and i was going 75mph just one hundred feet or so behind it. i reflexively swerved and avoided it, but swerved to the right rather than the left which woudl have my instinct. but i went to the right because 10-15 seconds earlier, i noticed the bsm warning light on my driver's side mirror in my peripheral vision. without bsm, i would have went to the left and hit that vehicle! 

that experience gave me an ever higher level of appreciation for bsm. it also made me very thankful that i was driving a mazda instead of my previous ford or most new suvs of similr size. i don't think anything else could have handled a high-speed emergency maneuver like that without losing control....zoom, zoom!

back to the rear cross traffic alert feature i mentioned earlier....the bsm cameras scan for oncomoing vehicles when the vehicle is in reverse and alerts you if it detects anything. for backing out of blind parking spots, it's a god-send. i wish my 2012 had it.

but there are many new 'safety' features showing up on new car that are way 'over the top'! one of my favorites is on the 2014 mazda known by the acronym fow. fow stands for forward obstruction warning, which uses laser sensors mounted behind the front grille to scan the road ahead for obstacles (car, people, debris) and alerts the driver if it detects something. every car i've owned, starting way back with my '85 crx has featured fow also- it's called a windshield!!! you look out of it and, if something is in your way, you stop or go around it....problem solved! 

mazda takes it even further, though. if the fow system doesn't think the driver has time to respond or no evasive action is taken based on the warning, the system will cut the throttle and apply full braking force automatically! 

if you need a car to do all of that for you, you're too dumb or too lazy to drive! the same goes for freakin' rain-sensing wipers...."

,,ferodo street sport pads. expensive? yes. worth it? yes.

the mini is not a factor it is a niche car with no bmwna support. they have their own dealerships and are very limited in the markets they sell in. for me i'd consider one but the dealer would be 1.5 hours away and that's a long haul for an oil change and never mind a repair where they have to keep the car for a few days.
bmw will price the 1 series below their own 3 series. realistically they have a certain gap between all the car.
i'm going with the coupe because the 1 series is initially a coupe. oh and this is msrp not what tmv is since it doesn't exist on the 2008's 3 series the 5 series is 2008 prices and the 1 series is a 2008. still the numbers should hold.

the base bmw coupe msrp is $35,300
the base bmw coupe msrp is $40,800
difference between the two car $5,500

the base bmw sedan (no coupe available) msrp $44,300
the base bmw sedan msrp $49,400

the difference between the bmw and the bmw is $5,100
the difference between the bmw and the bmw is $9,000
the difference between the bmw and the bmw is $8,600

there is no way the base msrp on the 1 series coupe will be $30k

looking at the figures it makes sense for bmw to slot the 1 series under the other car makers noses. based on the above figures and sure it's all msrp but discounts cannot be counted on, msrp is a given.
i see the base bmw msrp at $26,300
and the base 135i msrp at $31,400

i think this is what is most likely based on extrapolating figures between the 3 and 5 series.
however i think to pull in more buyers and of course with obvious discounts the bmw could sell for as low as $25k base and the 135i at $30k. options will boost up the prices. i still think it's high for the market but what the market will bear is another thing.

i think a lower price will draw in more customers and new blood but i'm not bmw. but these figures seem to be pretty close. value at this price point will be determined by the buyers.

,,x3s are made in austria.. it's the x5 that is made in south carolina..
,,"true, but all prices crept up. top line of ford ford (compact ""economy"") is over $28k (msrp), v6 version of ""midsize family"" honda/toyota/nissan goes deep into thirties - so why so suprised that the most expensive brand of ellps (or at least one of top 3) goes over $50k? 

i guess what i feel is that $50k for a 3 series isn't a great value. but value is a subjective measure where price is an objective measure.

now i can't see why bmw doesn't produce the 3 series in spartanburg for north american consumption. if people are willing to fork over $50k for a 3, why not build it here and cut out the euro penalty? bmw could probably increase gross profit by 20%."

yes, the tlx's 2.4 is direct injected....

https://acuranews.com/acura-automobiles/channels/tlx-press-kit/releases/2018-acura-tlx-press-kit-powertrain

2.4-liter engine i-vtec® valve control system
the tlx's direct-injected 2.4-liter dohc 16-valve i-vtec® engine uses an advanced valve-control system to combine high power output with high fuel efficiency and low emissions. the system combines vtc (variable timing control), which continuously adjusts the intake camshaft phase, with variable valve timing and lift electronic control (vtec), which changes valve lift, timing and duration of the intake valves.

at low rpm, the vtec intake valve timing and lift are optimized for high torque and low fuel consumption. as engine rpm builds past 4,900 rpm, the vtec system transitions to a high-lift, long-duration intake cam profile for superior high-rpm engine power.

the ""intelligent"" portion of the system is its ability to continuously vary the timing of the intake cam relative to that of the exhaust camshaft. this helps boost power and also provides a smoother idle (allowing idle speed to be reduced). the intake cam timing is varied based on input from sensors that monitor rpm, timing, throttle opening, cam position and exhaust air-fuel ratio. the result is increased fuel efficiency and lower nox emissions."

it may well be true that a 335 would fit a $45k ceiling (for an rwd only version), but -- according to the bmw dealership here in river honda -- over 40%, of all 3 series sold are awd. and, here in our climate, i was told the number now favors the x - drive versions as the majority sold.

,,"hi mark,

i can agree on some of your points and disagree on others. first, i do think the cts is a member of the 5 series competitor club with the exception of the non-availability of v8 power. it has just about everything else. there are a few options sometimes found in this group (lane change avoidance) that are still only available on the sts, probably to keep some product seperation while that model goes on its long march to oblivion.

and regarding infiniti, ah yes, they do upset the ol' product line apple cart, don't they? the m35 is on the large size of the class, mostly in terms of length (one of the reasons i liked it...it's always been on my short list). the g35 is supposed to be the bmw 3 series competitor, but in terms of size, it's the ""tweener car"" that the old cts was. the g35 is a small midsize car that's on the small size of the bmw class in terms of length and about and inch and change shorter in wheelbase. the width is narrower, much like the old cts. as a result, it's playing in that ""i can be a 3 series competitor and give you more room"" role that the old cts was doing. as a result, it's simular engine power but smaller mass gives it a small advantage to the new cts but still nips the heels of the smaller bmw.

given your previous posts, i know awd is a bigger priority for you up in ohio versus for me down in tennessee. and that's fine by me. the g35 awd will probably pull a more sporting performance that the cts awd given a likely 400-500 lb weight advantage. the cts gives the driver more interior room (especially leg room) which is a bigger priority for me (top priority really)."

huge difference. quiet, refined, and what you want in terms of proper luxury. 

the main reason acura, infiniti, and lexus all come off as trying too hard and a bit plain vanilla is because in japan, they don't really exist. there is honda. period. there is nissan. end of choices. toyota just recently stsrted selling lexus over there, but for almost two decades, it was simply another model of toyota.

mercedes-benz benz, they make luxury car and that's it aside from a few military vehicles and their commercial truck line. it's not a standard vehicle that's been tweaked and had a lot of bling added. it's the real deal. bmw is the same. and audi, though they are a lot like volkswagen in some ways, has always been its own company and own engineering. a lot like say, cadillac - there has been some overlap from time to time with the lower end models, but it's always been its own company/line. 

acura does nothing for me. in fact, volvo makes better car these days. (very nice, in fact, and off of most people's radar here) infiniti has their highest-end large car, which is good, and proper luxury, but it's also huge and basically like a big lexus in how it drives. and, lastly, lexus. very nice, but still so devoid of soul and personality that it screams ""safe vanilla choice""."

,,"you beat me to it. 

funny thing; i live in a rather hilly part of (often) snowy new hampshire and i have yet to understand why so many folks ""need"" awd. i mean geez, unless you have a driveway like my 'cross the street neighbor (a driveway that rises more than 100' over a distance of about 250'), i feel that the extra weight of an awd system can actually lead to a less safe vehicle when it's slippery out there. ""less safe?"" some might question. yes, less safe. why? because the extra weight will, if anything, lengthen stopping distances and reduce the already diminished capacity for a quick maneuver.

fwiw #1, when we moved up here i had a 530i sp, and after the first quarter inch snow fall i promptly ordered a set of winter wheels and tires; they in turn transformed my bmw from a car that couldn't make it up my driveway (only a 9% grade), to a car that could easily reel in awd and 4wd vehicles in rutted snow up to about 7"" deep (beyond that my car would turn into a snow plow, causing me to simply stay home or leave it at home in favor of a set of cross-country skis).

fwiw #2, the neighbor i referred to above has a winter tire shod audi audi audi, and as often as not, when the snow flies i see his car either parked down by the street, or stuck kinda sideways some distance up above the road. said another way, even awd isn't all it's cracked up to be on really steep slopes."

4-doors...if you can wait the new audi looks very interesting...the base is250 can be had with manual and it starts our at a reasonable price...though not fwd (have yet to drive). i recently drove a cts (doesn't get much love) both high end and base (manual) and found them very compelling (but probably not for my $'s)

manual...if you're weighing the pros and cos of a manual versus automatic you can check out volkswagen's dsg. last year i drove a volkswagen volkswagen fahrenheit and it was the most amazing fwd car i've driven (was 27k ish...)

i'm trying to talk myself into buying used next time around, so i'm trying to look at the glass as half full. most bmw here in the north east are leased for 3 years. when the lease is up, the car has anywhere from 30k to 45k miles on it. the car is still under warranty, has had all maintenance done by the dealer (ok, so not by mike miller's old school maintenance schedule) and is still in relatively good condition. it might have a new set of tires, fresh oil, and at least front brake pads & rotors. bmw are wonderfully built machines who's life is far from over when the 50k mile warranty expires."

kia will have a hard time getting people who own bmw's, audi's, lexus and mb to come into their dealership to look at the kia, the perception would be, the kia isn't to the level of the germans, but if one looks deep enough they will find out that they are. it would hard for a mb owner to see themselves driving a kia.
i think kia and hyundia have a big uphill battle to deal with, it might have been for them to take a play out of honda, toyota and nissan and make a luxury brand outside of kia and hyundia. mazda was going to have amati as their luxury brand and didn't go through with it, i think this is why you wont see a 50-60k mazda, getting people to spend that kind of money for mazada will be tough, very tough."

,,"i've now spent a bit of time ""initializing"" the s4's mmi system parameters -- including audi connect (free for 6-months). in terms of ease of use, the mmi user interface remains super easy, one could argue it is almost intuitive. what i do notice, this time, in comparison to my 2009 audi prestige, is that there seems to be more that can be configured via the mmi. i had to chuckle when i pressed the car button and was presented with the ability to set my individual preferences and one of them pertained to the engine/exhaust sound: ""toyota,"" ""auto,"" or ""dynamic."" this option must be there simply ""because they could."" i guess when your car stickers at north of $56k, you need to be able to rule your domain, so to speak.

i do appreciate the new (to me) ability to speak entire phone numbers and entire addresses without having to spell things out or use the rotary knob to dial in o-n-e l-e-t-t-e-r a-t a t-i-m-e. big move forward in voice recognition. pairing my iphone 5, too, was a snap -- but, there is no easy way to use the iphone (other than bluetooth) since the supplied cable is only good for iphone's up to the 4s models. that is one thing acura did a better job of: media connectivity. i mean, you could use a usb or a mini-stereo (male) plug or bluetooth or all three at the same time. 

audi uses its own proprietary cable and you can't have your iphone set up for two functions: one bluetooth and one hardwired ""connection"" are not supported. my primary reason for not using bluetooth has been i wanted to keep the phone in charge mode while i was driving, and the acura allowed just that by plugging one end of the cable into the iphone and one end into a female usb which charged the iphone and allowed both ipod and phone functions to operate without first shutting one down to use the other.

it is a small thing -- but sometimes it just makes one wonder why they can produce such a technologically advanced vehicle but overlook what most of us have come to expect in a plug''n'-play world.

another cool feature -- but one that is not worth $30/month after the 6 month free trial ends -- is audi connect that will actually show google earth pictures on the nav screen -- in excellent clarity. not sure why i'd pay for that. now, i know the stated ""value"" of audi connect is that it turns the interior of the s4 into a wifi hotspot -- but here's the thing, the only carrier offered is t-mobile and the signal is restricted to 3g. those of you with the outdated apple iphone 5 know that your phone can be made into a wifi hot spot (and that is just a ""standard"" feature of the iphone); but, the difference is, depending on your carrier, i suppose, the iphone can be 4g lte, which would make someone's laptop using your iphone wifi hotspot run faster. yes, the audi connect is more than a wifi hotspot enabler, but, really, if i needed a hotspot while driving, the iphone works well and you can buy a hell of a lot of ""band"" for an extra $30 per month.

i guess i look at audi connect as a too expensive technology considering its data fees. if my mind changes, i'll report back to you.

ok, once you get all (or most) of the mmi options set the way you want them, you're ready to punch the start button and -- finally -- take this sublime machine out on the road.

i set my audi drive select to dynamic and put the s-tronic in d (which becomes ""s"" when set to dynamic via the mmi) and pulled out of the driveway. 

the power that is available underfoot is hard to describe -- i am tempted to hyperventilate and gush ""the power feels limitless,"" which it does, but i won't, for i know someone, somewhere will point out a quicker, stronger and even more capable vehicle. for the life of me, though, when i read (or watch on youtube) the test reports and see 0-60 in 4.4 seconds as the tested performance, i now understand how quickly the s4 reaches speed without muss nor fuss and without my even noticing it. its ""pick up"" is so quick and so smooth, it cautions me to watch the gauges since there are few signals of how quickly speed rises (and i am cautioned by the local long arm of the law, too).

braking, too, makes me now think i understand how landing on an aircraft carrier must feel -- the brakes shed speed with incredible -- ""you've got to feel it to believe it"" -- aplomb.

my 2009 audi was a quiet car to ride in -- not compared to the 2014 s4, though. the s4 almost makes me believe there might be some actual practical purpose to the mmi setting governing engine/exhaust sound -- you might need to hear something to clue you in just how quickly you got to extra-legal speeds. lord knows there isn't much in the way of an audible cue to give you a sense of velocity.

speaking of sound -- the acura tl (advance) has, to this day, not been bettered in terms of the sound system acura blesses it [the tl advance] with -- the b&o sound system in the s4 is ""cleaner and clearer"" than my fading memory of my 2009 audi b&o. nothing, so far, come close to the sound of a dvd-audio recording (or a dts disc, for that matter), but the current iteration of the b&o system is a welcome improvement. the hd radio as well as siriusxm probably sound as good as these technologies (and transmission limitations) can deliver, so i'll simply suggest checking off the b&o option box should you choose audi from the ellps list.

with such green tires it is difficult to say anything about the ""handling"" of the s4 -- since it will surely improve over the next few days as the ""green-ness"" of the tires is scrubbed away. by the way, i chose (of my own free will) to get the 18"" uhp a/s tires instead of the max perf summer-only rubber. i live in cincinnati for pity's sake -- the freeways are crowded (so what good is a 155 mph limiter?) and we do have moderate winters with a couple of days of snow cover here and there -- besides, the summer rubber audi chooses really has a short tread life in my experience. i'll live (in shame) with a 130 mph limiter in other words.

that's it for now.

i'll close and wonder why (considering the price and the ""natural comparison"") the s4 was not thrown in the mix of car that were compared to the new lexus is f sport. i would think the s4 might have given the judges pause. we'll see, maybe next time.

,,"just to expand on this a bit, awd hampers performance in some ways (more weight will always do that), but gains in back in others. the scca, at least, acknowledges that awd is an overall performance benefit, thereby putting the 227-hp subaru in the same class as the 300-hp 135i, and the 165-hp subaru in the same class as the volkswagen, honda si, and v6 hyundai coupe."

i think at this point i'd be replacing them. that can't be a hard job on that car."
,,"""if i put 800 miles/week, i will be worry more about the depreciation than the gas. 800 miles/week x 52 weeks = 41600 miles/year = a lot of depreciation. i rather buy a small/sport economy car (~18k) instead of a luxury car.""

yup, one of the several reasons why the 530i went back to bmw-fs at lease end, and why, instead of replacing it, i chose to drive our old ""spare car"" (home depot/dump run hack with ~80,000 on the clock at the time) for the duration of that contract. during the 21 months that i serviced that client i put on just shy of 80,000 miles in spite of the fact that i was occasionally traveling and it sat in the garage.

i'm now in the market for a new contract, and the two companies that seem to be the most likely candidates will have my mileage drop to a more normal 15,000 to 20,000 miles per year. assuming one of those two actually happen, i'm thinking the 2009 audi audi (which will have the new ""clean-sheet design"" ea 888 engine), with a 6-speed manual of course. the only rub with that car is that it is ""wrong wheel drive"", however, it does sport a spare tire well complete with a donut spare (but room for a full size wheel/tire), a jack, real gfts, a dip-stick tube for checking/changing the oil, and room in the back to schlep around our new mutt.

the flip side is that the company i was with for those 21 months is, a) talking of giving me another juicy contract, and  has moved their offices some 20 miles further (each way) from our home. if i end up back there, geez, i'm thinking either a new honda honda honda 6-speed or a 2009 volkswagen tdi 6-speed, car i can put 100,000 miles on in two years and not suffer too much from the depreciation.

,,"honestly, if someone is cross-shopping the two, intending to lease, there's not enough difference in price for price to be the deciding factor. plenty of people do like the bmw included maintenance. i think a few oil changes and tire rotations is a bit of an underestimate - it'll probably chew through brake pads (and rotors) as well."

,,"it has been a great car for me -- the engine is still very smooth, and the transmission is also ok. in 14 years, i have only had one repair issue (electrical). it has been a great car, and also gets very good gas mileage (28mpg in mixed driving).

it is not quiet -- my main complaint about this car has been the plastic inside is very cheap, so all of the door handles are cracked or broken, several knobs have broken, etc. when it runs, it has lots of rattles, and is noisy with all of the vibrating plastic. also, 3 of the 4 rims are slightly bent, so that also makes the ride quite rough.

it only has 116k miles, so i wouldn't be surprised to see the engine/transmission to last another 60k or 70k miles at least. i will sell it to someone fully confident that it will be a good car for them. do you want to buy it?  just kidding. :p

,,"you wrote: ""we all know that bmw wouldn't make a no frills sport sedan. . . ""

perhaps you should amend that by adding . . .that they would export to the us (and probably some other regions as well.) although my last visit to germany was in 2006, i have been there about 25 times and several times i have rented (from avis or hertz, etc) car for part of my time in europe -- primarily so that i can drive on the autobahn.

audi, bmw and mercedes-benz benz alike make and sell many ""no frills"" vehicles and versions of the car we get here in the us that are way way down scale in features, functions, content and performance.

many european taxis are base-r than basic german car -- no carpet, plastic seat, no ""glintzy"" trim bits puny, puny powerplants -- and completely devoid of any kind of bling or high-end pretense. 

it seems to me that there is room for these ""high end"" [german] manufacturers to bring all kinds of higher end and lower end products to the us. in fact it is probably quite easy to bring out less expensive versions of our market (i.e., premium) audis, bmw and mercedes-benz benz across the board (within reason, of course). 

moreover, it seems folks will, given the choice and a way to justify the cost, always take the acura over the honda, the audi over the volkswagen, the lexus over the toyota and the infiniti over the nissan (to name a few.)

and, unless the manufacturer is so stupid as to not differentiate between the lexus and the toyota, there will be a very noticeable difference between the pedestrian and the sublime versions.

i think gone are the days where the emperor truly had no clothes -- today there is a wide margin between the chevrolet chevrolet and the cadillac cadillac -- and the price reflects the difference (and perhaps over reflects it, to be fair and balanced.)

the volkswagen quantum and the audi 4000 (remember when?) were much more like fraternal twins then than any more recent models.

you may believe (and i typically agree) that the infiniti isn't worth the uptick in price over a ""similar"" nissan, but the infiniti (or whatever you're on about) is different, more -- and most pros and amateurs alike would say ""better.""

there is an apropos phrase that mostly fits here: ""the bitterness of poor quality remains long after the sweetness of low price is forgotten. . . ."" 

now of course i could be wrong (but not uncertain) -- but if i am wrong, then by this time next year we'll all be buying and driving kia kia's -- 'cause lordy lordy there ain't nuttin' that even comes close to this puppy at any price.

i have been, more than once, unable to afford the ""better car"" (i'm driving a freakin' acura tl for pity's sake -- after years of only having audis -- i am living proof!) -- but i never stopped thinking the car i had to pass on (due to my financial circumstances) wasn't worth its asking price.

i'm already counting down the days until i will return to my favorite german car dealership (and, to be fair, i will also check out what acura and infiniti are offering up at the moment of truth). we all rationalize -- or at least most of us do; but it is unlikely that a fine high-zoot german sedan will seem similar to even the best mazda 6. we tell ourselves that the mazda is just as good (or close enough) as the german (or whatever premium car is your first love) offering to rationalize our choices.

i could live with an acura tl -- if i have to -- for years, they are very good car and good values (and they seem durable as all get out). but, if i am in a position to return to the real premium brands (and you know who they are), i'll do so in a new york minute.

so, yes, i agree with where i think you are going ... boards that divide by class and forget this whole pesky ""entry level"" tag, since that obviously varies by manufacturer for the time being.
except that the acura and cla are both considered compacts by the epa. so are we now going to identify by barely a compact and almost a mid-size?"

,,"seriously, what is wrong with you? for the last time, i did not say acura sales tanked, i said acura sales had not tanked! :mad: 

just because they have decreased over the last two years by a few thousand does not mean they are tanking and as i just showed you in a post above, the acura is higher in sales this year thus far then at this time last year hence a upward rise. 

yeah, your figures really showed how bad the acura sales have tanked :blush: 

and here is the figures for the tl to show its decrease in sales and thus poor sales performance, taken from acura media newsroom.

ytd 2010
 25,031

ytd 2009
 25,882

ytd - 1.8% 

tl 2004 sales: 77,895
tl 2005 sales: 78,218
tl 2006 sales: 72,348
tl 2007 sales: 58,545
tl 2008 sales: 48,766
tl 2009 sales: 33,620 

as you can see, the sales decrease in the tl is quite substantial compared to the acura and hence why i have said tanked for the tl. it is sad considering the tl was acura's bread and butter model for so many years and that now has changed to the acura. you can state a whole host of reasons why it dropped but its safe to say that the acura has been a better success for them then the tl is right now."

,,"i see i confused you, people. it was $1000 off the ""euro delivery"" msrp, not us delivery msrp. 

bmw maintains separate pricing sheets for each type of delivery. they both have same invoice-msrp structure. delivery euro prices are negotiable same way as us delivery prices. 

here is the deal, more less:
base msrp for bmw wagon is $38,395, euro msrp = 0.93*38,395=$35,700
options: $8550 (same for each type of delivery)
totals: us del: 46945, euro del: 44250. my price: 43250, incuding dealer's fee. of course add taxes.
so it is about $4000 less than us msrp, but i have to pay the trip to munich. 

when i say ""discount"", in context of euro delivery, it has the same meaning as ""discount"" in context in us delivery, but from lowered base. it is because the base is lowered not by the dealer's good heart, but by bmw of us. 

this is main difference between bmw and mercedes-benz benz, audi, or volvo european deliveries. bmw has the prices negotiable, the other ones have the prices fixed, no negotiations.

,,"do the manufacturers read our rants and raves?
i shared the story of the s4 that couldn't (or wouldn't) be made right with my lawyer wife. the first thing she said was ""doesn't someone from audi read the comments on edmunds and audiworld?"" she elaborated that it appears that it would be less expensive to have simply replaced the un-fixable s4 rather than have the story be posted in no small amount of detail on the web.
my own questions have to do somewhat with the dealer -- who was paid at the time of sale and is paid for warranty work. you'd think the dealer, who apparently is not losing any money on this customer would be interested in going the distance to get the customer's issue resolved. if the dealer was bleeding dollar bills, i could almost understand their reluctance to throw more money (mostly represented, i would assume, by time) at the problem.
audi (and others) must have interns that read our posts, maybe even computer programs that comb the internet looking for keywords (the audi spiders?) and bringing stories to the attention of said interns. unless they don't have such interns or programs, it would seem valuable -- in marketing terms alone -- to have addressed the ailing s4's issues rather than seeing them escalate to the point that the customer gives up in frustration.
i mean it was not like there were ""attacks"" or rants (without substantiation) posted; no name calling, etc. so for the wholesale cost of a new car the customer good-will would have, i can imagine, offset the ill-will and frustration laid out here for all to see.
the question stands -- do the manufacturers have folks who monitor what we write about their products and when there seems to be a less than positive issue, intervene?
on the subject of separation (by audi from volkswagen or by infiniti from nissan, for instance), it does indeed appear that when the premium car maximizes its separation from the more humble ""parent"" they both win. porsche, still in not very old memory, was building a number of car that shared way too many volkswagen components -- and those car were damn near crucified by the motor reviewing press (and customers). porsche virtually stopped this practice and the market responded positively.
these days there are still parts sharing (between and among car company's cousins), but when the audi division began to separate itself further and further from volkswagen, audi's market and machines improved significantly. on the other side of this, infiniti's g is born with rwd, i know of no nissan analog, ditto the m -- but the jx was brought to market so quickly infiniti had to base it on a nissan product (fwd no less), and despite the jx's success (or lack of), it is probably not one of infiniti's shining moments in marketing or manufactuing.
bmw has no sub-bmw division or parent which can be said to be a strength, but also may put bmw in a precarious position in the future as we see the global consolidation of car companies gather momentum.

3. the extra mileage the honda gets will not offset the cost of acquiring another vehicle?

,,"stickguy said:i actually thought that the 320i, when it was introduced, was what purists were looking for. simpler, marginally lighter, cheaper. more of the spiritual descendant to the early 2002 and 3 series car than a massively powered 335. the volume model in the later 90s/early 2000s was likely the 323/325, right? 

so if anything, the 320 really is the entry level bmw to allow people that want one to get into ""the family"", same as the 323/325 did previously. it drives like a bmw, looks and feels like one, etc. so if anything, the purist's problem shouldn't be with the 320, it is the whole series.

some people (including myself) just want a good handling car that can get out of its own way and offers some creature comforts.

the majority want a 3 pointed star, or a roundel. their car hunt begins and ends there.

stick....i view the 320i to be a spiritual successor to the 2002. having been in one of the original 2002s (not mine, but a college friend's), they broke the mold. bmw has built on that success. they are where they are today as a result of the 2002's initial success."

2 - acura acura 6-speed -- fun to drive, lots of goodies (that i don't necessarily care about), and reasonable space in the back seat.

3 - lexus is250 rwd 6-speed -- extremely boring to drive with no ""feel"" of what's going on with the mechanicals or down on the road. this car also suffers from an anemic engine (at least until you wind it up even higher than the acura's already high strung mill) and a back seat that is all but laughable. in every respect, this car is a very distant third of the three.

we almost always do this: ""i wish"" i had configured the sport differential on my order; ""i wish"" 19"" wheels with a/s uhp tires were offered as an option; ""i wish"" the tracking headlights were offered on the p+ s4 (like are on my wife's new prestige sq5); and i wish the a/s tires were not simply grand touring models, but uhp's like we put on the sq5 (continental dsw's). but, even without my wish list, this is (these two car -- my s4 and her sq5 are) the best audis ever, and my (and my wife's) most favorite car -- ever.

every time i push the start button, put the car in dynamic mode (which actually the car ""remembers"" from the first time) and take off, i am impressed by the seemingly intuitive transmission and the sense of an almost unlimited well of horsepower and torque. now that i have 2,000 miles on mine, i am unafraid to floor the accelerator, and find it to be an absolute rush every time i do.

i don't know -- and with all due respect, i don't know how you know -- about audi deciding the rs7 customer would not track the car, hence they (audi) decided not to use the transmission that they typically tout as the one they reserve for their high performance car. it is as if their engine technology advanced more quickly than their transmission supplier could keep up with, so they used the 8-speed tip instead of waiting for the dsg to get strong enough to handle the power of the rs7 motor.

i have no problem at all with you upgrading your engine, knowing that the transmission will attempt to protect itself when it is pushed beyond its toyota zone. i don't have the money that it would take to self insure against the risk.

frankly, i think it would be less costly to get a new ""s"" with the uprated engine -- when it comes out perhaps as a 2016 -- rather than push the dsg with the upgrade.

of course, if you upgrade and nothing untoward goes down, well your risk will have been proven to be low.

my experience with ""chipping"" is perhaps why i am concerned -- i chipped my wife's tt and the power and acceleration were thrilling -- but the damn thing went from being reliable (and i assume durable) to needing constant visits to the dealer for things that seemed to have started coincidentally with the chip's installation.

my wife swore (and i couldn't counter her argument) that all the ills that beset her tt were chip related.

we traded the car in for a newer tt with the factory upgrated engine -- the thing was bullet proof.

summary: good luck and godspeed with your upgrade. i'll just wait for the factory to offer up an amped up s car without any post oem help.


my audi mods did the opposite of souring me on mods. if anything though, i felt they over advertised the power improvements , or at least overstated them, didn't pass the butt dyno.

i can understand being soured to tuning if you've had issues in the past. however, if the car was old, maybe it was just due to have those same failures anyway? also, what kind of tune (company?) was it. i got unitronics with the audi, and part of their sales spiel is that they tune it with oem like reliability and durability in mind. of course, my s4 tune will be revo, so new territory. i find the audi components to be over engineered so that they can handle these tunes with ease if done right."

however, one thing nobody can deny is that the cts is currently the interior standard of the segment. the quality of materials and fit-'n-finish is just amazing, but both the front and rear seat can be comfortable though.

,,"graphicguy said:i've tried to like infinitis for a long time. every time i look at them and test drive them, i'm disappointed.

assuming the infiniti used to be the former m chassis. what's the point of going from one letter to another?

i know they did make a drastic price cut of the former g series, and that may be saving their bacon. but, even there, it's long in the tooth and certainly not very fuel efficient, by any stretch.

i just don't know where they are competing.
well, here are some thoughts on infiniti -- from a former owner of an infiniti product and also, at the same time, an acura product.

the auto manufacturers in the past decades have wanted to ""rationalize"" their product names. they have wanted to do so for essentially a singular purpose: marketing (leading to increased market share, mind share, sales, etc.)

infiniti decided that q was the answer as a prefix and that the following numbers/letter combination would signify the size or perhaps even class of the vehicle. i would assume if money were no object they would have liked to have rolled out a completely new -- across the board -- product family. they had to settle for one new car, the infiniti. the m37 became the infiniti as you identified.

it is true that most of us here on edmunds know the infiniti is the former m37. i would posit that most people, however, won't have a clue that the infiniti is a renamed product.

the m37 and the infiniti are still very competent lps offerings, even though the infiniti does need to be updated, refreshed or replaced with a newer version. to me, infinitis have often been [note the tense] the most german-like of the japanese (and korean) offerings. the recent ""transfer"" of their president, johan de nysschen, (then late of audi) to go to cadillac probably is a negative for infiniti -- but, well, there you have it -- since i would have assumed johan would have made good use of his 19-year audi stint to imbue infiniti with even more german-ness.

right now, it seems to me that infiniti and acura, both, appear to be somewhat rudderless if their recent products are any indication of what is going on ""at the top."" the tlx could've have been the vehicle for acura to announce ""we're not honda anymore,"" but i think they missed the target completely if you axed me. 

meantime, lexus has inched its way even further from toyota and the koreans are the ones the germans are probably seeing in their rear-view mirrors more so than anything out of japan (with the possible exception of the is350f-sport).

again, if you axed me, the saving grace for the germans is the brand name ""kia"" -- at least if you live here in river honda where removing all the kia badges seems the norm. if kia somehow figures out a new name (think goldstar becoming lg) for their brand, i would think the germans might have more to worry about.

today, the germans seem to be the aspirational car -- but, as the poet frost once said, ""nothing gold can stay."" i did enjoy my time with my 2012 acura tl sh-awd advance, but -- money not a factor -- my 2014 s4 is an entirely different experience (despite my belief that the tl was about as close to an s4 as one could get for about $47k.)

with the msrp of the cadillac so close to that of the lexus or bmw, etc, and with the ability to almost literally test drive several brands on any given saturday, cadillac probably seems -- at this point -- to be overpriced or for whatever reason is undervalued. 


i think another compounding issue is that if the pricing is similar, the depreciation of caddy is higher, so lease monthlies are going to be higher (that's my guess, i haven't checked). since a lease is basically the financing of depreciation, the greater depreciation would actually make caddy more expensive than those other brands, would it not, and is that actually the case? or is gm basically reducing the price (effectively) by subsidizing the leases to remain at least at parity?"
,,"markcincinnati said:because they can . . .

maybe this is old fashioned thinking.

it seems to me, if you're going to market your car with a choice of ten standard (non-custom) colors, the price should include the cost of the paint. when the customer requests a ""non-standard"" or custom color, well, whatever the traffic will allow should govern the price.

i've taken the tour through the audi factory in germany (6 times), and they are very proud of the part of the tour where you get to see the paint booth. there is a display near the paint facility that has the entire spectrum of available colors displayed as somewhat large paint chips (for the workers or the customers? to see). there were dozens of audi colors apparently able to be specified -- i would call them non-custom.

i understand that pearl swirl pink is probably not a color chosen often, ditto some fantastic purple swirl colors -- but, i assume the fact that they are ""on the wall"" means the factory just didn't make a one-off paint blend for a customer (perhaps bentley does this, but i would not imagine audi would not for $1,000, in other words.)

we're down to two (black gloss and white gloss) standard colors these days -- literally every other standard color costs extra. the audi exclusive line (should one toyota into their paint pallet) costs even more on top of that.

it just irks me to be charged for something that shouldn't be a question. silver is not a custom color, hell, even the purple infused black audi calls panther black justifies a $1,000+ optional add on. pull the other one.

i know, i know, everyone does it and seems to get away with it -- and i do assume that some paint colors cost more to fabricate than others, but couldn't these companies just bury the cost in the base price and let the customer pick what they want. this is especially annoying since most folks don't order their car, and therefore have no say. 

rare is the car on the lot that is gloss black -- the ones on the lot are pearl black or panther black or oolong black or whatever the name du jour is. but at anything over 10 feet away, they all look black and shiny.

even the ibis white (a free color) looks little, if any, different than the metallic white offered -- beyond 10 feet away.

i had no issue paying for a full-on leather interior (no alcantara, that is) for my s4, but i would have been miffed if leather was standard and yet red leather was $1,000 upcharge. god help me if i wanted the leather in a non-standard color.

i'd gladly pay for a heated steering wheel or heated rear seat -- those options weren't available. but 'cmon, black or white paint or pay up? luckily i am fine with white.

now, my wife, on the other hand, just rolls with it and says, $1,075 for the color is ok. 

i've watched the car being painted, mostly it's done by robots -- does it really cost that much extra to get one in silver? 

roll up your arm and bend over!
it's all marketing and revenue maximization. show a lower base price, but then make sure everything is an upcharge. bmw has been doing this for decades, audi (at least in the us) not as long but they are getting there more and more.

it's the same reason you can get a certain cell phone for some lower price but the base model has only 16gb which is pretty minimal. of course the upcharge to 32 or 64mb is way out of proportion to the actual cost of those changes for the manufacturer. instant profit!"

,,"i think we're basically in violent agreement. and audis are nose heavy and overall fairly heavy car. yet, what we've not discussed is the fact that all of these car companies -- even the ones that are ""related"" (like audi, porsche and volkswagen, et al) -- make whatever helps them meet their revenue, volume and profit objectives. some time ago, a bmw owner told me, as he looked down on my audi, that bmw would never produce anything other than rwd car. 

i'd say we've pretty much incorporated x-drive across virtually all bmw's -- because they sell and because they make profit.

someone told me that porsche would never make a cuv (or suv) and would never create a sedan and that porsche's were ""only"" about performance -- then the 944 came out.

btw there is a team of lawyers who look out for the use of coke (little c) -- they always want to see it as coke. likewise audi is well, ""audi"" not quatro or audi -- the audi legal team will, no doubt, be sending edmunds a cease and desist demand if they allow us to post the brand incorrectly. 

virtually all i see here in cincinnati are awd porsches -- and i suspect the two porsche dealers are happy as a clam in its shell to sell as many of them as they can get their hands on.

for most mere mortals, living through even our ""moderate"" winters, awd vehicles are more, dare i say, practical. the fact that some of the highest performing vehicles are offered in awd trim is, for some, a bonus.

sween.....i try....i try really, really hard to ignore your narcissism. 

i'm about to fail miserably! 

we get it. 

any car that's not your beloved g falls down in comparison in some way, shape or form. they either cost too much, they don't have a transmission you like, they have too many doors, they don't have the right label on the quarter panels, etc. 

you've taken a driving class. that's qualified you to belittle those of us who have built a track car, and/or actually have had track time.

we get it. 

the only transmission you like is a manual transmission. nothing else is worthy, regardless of how good it might be.

anyone who posts anything in here except what you want to post about is called out by you. you criticize anyone, with any vehicle, with any level of experience (or lack thereof) on the road, on the track, anywhere unless it's a g. 

you criticize, criticize, criticize....most other posters, most other posters' car (except those who have a g), etc, etc etc!!!!!!!!!!!

we get it! 

we get it!

we get it!

enough already!"

in a sharply worded letter to de nysschen dated aug. 3 and obtained by automotive news, seven state dealer association heads say project pinnacle would create several tiers of ""effective pricing,"" as cad-illac funnels a disproportionate amount of money to larger, urban stores that are better able to make pricey investments in services such as complimentary roadside assistance.

,,"so we drove from erbusco to marseilles france yesterday, we decided to just do the superslab and get there fast, well 8 hour fast..

so my impressions of italian drivers, they aren't as reckless as you hear about, they follow most of the german or austrian driving rules, 1) they only use the right lane to pass, 2) they use their left turn signal if they want you to move over, and 3) yes, some are crazy.

so we are motoring down the audi autostrata and come up to slower traffic so we slow down, then barreling down on us is a volkswagen volkswagen wagon (they are big in italy) and yes, it's a tdi.. the volkswagen driving is flashing his lights, turn signal on, looks pissed that i didn't move over, once we clear traffic and people move over (this whole time volkswagen driver is inch's from my bumper) i nail the gas (we have 2200km on the car) and wham, talk off. volkswagen growing smaller and smaller in the mirror. top out at 135mph, we reach slower traffic, volkswagen own barreling down doing the same thing, flashing lights, turn signal, giving me the italian salute, not too sure if it was a good one or bad one. again, once traffic opens up, and people move up, i take off, and the volkswagen gets smaller and smaller in the mirror. again, top out at 135, reach slower traffic, again volkswagen driver flashing lights and turn signal, this time once we clear traffic, i get in front of slower traffic and pulled over the right land (this audi has 3 lane's in each direction) and the volkswagen pulled up, it's quite funny, he can tell he has it floored but not moving so fast, i nail it get in front, and pull away. had to slow down speed limit lowered to 110 kph. volkswagen owner catch's up and passes me.. he finally got what he wanted. it's interesting that it doesn't matter what country they are from they all barrel down on you at warp drive then get stuck on your bumper like that is going to make the car in front go faster.. 

france

what to say about france, if you think the germans have an aire of attitude, you need to come from france. the attitude is, we can do that because we are french... merging traffic, they will pull in front of you if there is day light between you and the car in front, they don't care about their car, well most french don't. 

we stopped in monaco, did the tourist thing, stopped in front f the casino, and got a photo of the car, talk about crowded!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the car, wow, the car, i got one photo of a lambo, lots of make there too. the streets are narrow really narrow.. lots of construction going on and our gps wasn't updated on this, so it took a little longer to get to the casino, but we got there.

marseilles 

what to say about marseilles, i didn't know much about the honda except it was a port honda. it's a very old honda, and it shows, when you come in from the toll road, you come in through the slums, the gps worked great, some of the streets we went down, were really narrow,dirty, and stinky. insane is a word that rick used a lot....

my thoughts of marseilles, lots of immigrants, usually from north africa, lots of different cultures, christians, muslims and so on. have seen some women in burka's walking about here and all over europe, the native people of marseilles aren't happy with most of the immigrants. it's a very diverse honda, the food says it all, more on that later.

so here are the photos from our trip to france..

 in italy they have rest stop's but nothing like what have in the us, the rest stop has gas, food and places to eat the food outside, and they are superclean... the next couple of photos is one place we stopped to get gas and something to munch on.













so we stopped at a french version of the roadside gas/convenience store what a big difference, the placed looked like it was about to be shutdown, hardly no drinks in the coolers, and the bathrooms look disgusting (this was the real reason why we stopped) see for yourself. a far cry from what the ones in italy looked like,







so car's in europe, we have seen some american car over here, here is a photo of one that we had a good laugh at.




monaco is supper clean, very clean in fact. monaco is not a country, it is part of france, but it is a principality, their license plates say, principality of monaco on them..








so i know you are all waiting for that lambo photo, so here it is..



traffic lights are interesting here, if you do not stop behind the crosswalks you will not see the traffic lights, but the french being the french have a fix....




once again the gps, she works well, she really does but at times i have to wonder, when we left monaco, we put into the gps the hotel address and said, the faster route, even toll roads, well..... for about 60 km we were on two lane country roads, then finally back on the toll roads.. she tries..

i also agree with you that the 2 series m looks very nice, if the price could be kept under 50k i think bmw would have a major hit on their hands.

major reason for the twin turbo 6

better mpg, bmw wont meet the cafe that is set by our government, also driveability, the out going v8, thought nice, was really a dog in normal driving, from the reports of this new engine, one can drive it like a normal bmw in town and it wont have problem, the greater torque of the 6 will also allow bmw to get better mpg..."

,,"the 1 is ok. an e46 is fine. but, the 5 series never was any good, and i thought the outgoing 3 series (e90?) reverted back to just cheesey flip out arms (and no holes in the console)?

,,"i have no problem woth changing tech as long as the old one still works at least for a while. three years is too short, something like six may be acceptable, especially at prices charged by both apple and bmw. i do not accept premise that perfectly functioning $200 product should be tossed out so quickly for sake of new tech that does the same thing, like playing same music files at same quality. btw, my nano has up to date os, which means it is the new 328 interface not accepting it."
,,"quite likely. there is also some time lag to those surveys, so what you buy today may be different than what got dinged.

besides, at this point, with very few exceptions (alfa?) the bar is set so high, that even the ""worst"" brand is pretty darned good. especially considered where most were not all that long ago."
,,"simply put, the sq5 -- even at its price point -- offered more content, the immpeccable interior audi seems to do with aplomb, and oh that supercharged engine with zero lag, weapons grade torque -- and the sq5 had a gorgeous red leather interior to boot.

to get the same or similar content, the bmw was even more expensive; and i think she felt the sq5's interior, sport seat in particular plus the b&o sound system cinched it -- almost. panther black pearl paint sealed the deal. that plus a 6% discount on not your garden variety audi or x3 -- audi iimbues its ""s"" car with ""that certain something"" -- undoubtedly sealed the deal.

having matching interiors was probably a minor influencer, too.

she has had 2 x3's since 2005 -- very fond of them. but, if you've never driven an sq5 at full cry, you may not quite understand the almost immediate reaction: an ""addiction"" to the sound and the fury, wrapped up in what seems to be a premium car -- the bmw for all of its inherent goodness just doesn't seem as nice of a place to spend hours in. then, of course, there is that oh-so-cute flat bottomed sport steering wheel on the sq, too.

if you can take an sq5 out for a test drive. 

on the other hand . . .

the bmw is better balanced -- but the sq passes the triple speed around the curve test with ease and poise. as a practical matter, that attribute felt pretty much like a draw, despite the bmw's less heavy nose. the audi engineers did a very nice job taming the potetial understeer of the sq's fatter front-end.

just test drive an sq -- perhaps you too will want to keep on driving it, long aafter the test drive ends. one more thing, the sq5 is very rare, you won't see yourself coming and going -- the x3 even with the more potent i6 motivation is rather easy to find, and unlike the sq seems to do little to differentiate itself from the ""regular"" x3."
,,"imo, the g is what makes the 3 get better, ok, so they added more weight but i'll bet the weight issue is at the top of the ""to do"" list going forward for all of the engineers. think 35 mpg...not to mention that carbon fiber and such lighhtweight componenets will become more prevalent on the lesser ellps. 

now, the cts wants a little respect. ok, so lets see how many sales caddy takes away from the germans and the japanese. i would suspect some interesting numbers considering the exchange rate issue.

,,i just finished reading my latest c&d. nice preview drive and photos of the 2012 bmw.
,,"your link to that track in germany had an '09 tt rs tested with an unnamed driver. that's ancient by car standards.  granted, you could argue the cayman s and r are due for updates, but the '12 ttrs is faster than the '09 version i'd imagine, and a time around 8:00 will probably be easy with the 360 hp '12 version of the ttrs. the cayman time was for a 2010 model for what it's worth.

road & track has some figures that don't take into account curves, corners, and turns, but are useful for the audi owner pulling up alongside the porsche owner at a stoplight who revs their engine up to see who can get to the next stoplight fastest :p 

0-60 mph (ahhh, yes, awd works wonders): cayman r 4.4 ttrs 4.0 (that's smoked)

quarter mile: 12.8 for the cayman r, 12.6 for the tt rs (that's closer, and for the $20k+ difference in price it should be).

also, when they reviewed the ttrs in january's issue, i can't find it, but i remember them beating their very own cayman r's time around the track (don't remember which track they use).

audi club north america members in good standing also get the same supplier 6% discount. that's a very good deal! it's well below edmund's tmv of average transaction prices for the s4. however, i needed a great deal in order to go new. with the ""fancier"" leather, i was over my stretched $50k threshold (before taxes), without it, i met my price target. so my offer was $850 below the 6% discount. probably around 6.4%? i didn't do the math exactly. my audi ownership also gives me $1,000 loyalty rebate back on the back end after taxes as well. in ca, sales tax is ridiculous so figuring 10% for tax, title, license, and fees is about right i'm told. 

2014 s4 has audi drive select standard, in exchange for raising the msrp $500 bucks from 2013. the sport diff option went down $150 from 2013 probably because drive select is already on the car. i told them the price increase wasn't my fault, i'm sticking to my offer at $50,000."

#1 6-speed manual
#2 7-speed dct (m series, $2,900 option)
#3 7-speed dct (non-m, $450 option)
#4 8-speed automatic

let's not confuse high end dcts in the bmw or porsche's pdk in the 911 with the dct used by bmw in the standard 3/5 series. very different in terms of design, performance - and cost. $2,900 for the bmw, $4,000 for the pdk, $10,000 for ferrari. you aren't going to get that level of engineering or construction by checking a $450 box with bmw or volkswagen.

as for my manual shifting speed vs. a dct. that's not the issue. i'll give up a tenth or two in the 0-60 (one shift) drag race in order to get the direct control and the engagement factor of driving the car. i understand that's a personal choice. i'm no bubba watson, but i still play volkswagen from the tips of a 7,100 yard course because i want the full effect. i know i could score a few strokes better from the white tee box, but it wouldn't be as satisfying. it makes me laugh that some of my playing partners will spend $500 on a driver and then moan like babies when i suggest we play the black tees rather than the blues or whites. 

regarding the x5d, the flat torque curve is precisely why you don't need as many gears. every gear change results in energy loss. small, but a loss nonetheless. by the time you get to highway speeds, the final gear ratio is all that matters, not how many shifts it took to get there. around town, an extra gear or two might help, but a 5,300 pound curb weight is still the overriding factor."

i'm amazed at your comments at times - not everyone has been to germany to pick up one of 3bmws and had owned a chevrolet - im also not really up on leader ads - but one thing i do know is of you drive a manual the right hand has more to do then just turn the radio and text -so i'm all for it.

,,"i think you should look at the acura tl. it's front wheel drive like the lexus, gets excellent mpg, rated very high reliability and low maint especially if you plan on keeping it a long time(which you indicated). the german car will no doubt cost you more time and money after you get out of warranty time and miles. if you have to deal with snow the lexus and tl being fwd will be a little better for traction. the acura tl also comes in a awd version but based on your stated use and not caring that much about the handling i wouldn't recommend it as it is heavier, get less mpg and cost several thousand more. why pay for it if you're not really going to use it. the germans are all rwd with awd being optional but if you have to contend with a lot of bad weather and snow you would probably need the awd which, again, raises the price and lowers the mpg.

for that money i would go volkswagen r - or better yet volkswagen with a cool 15k? to invest . ha 
the $10-15k extra for the volkswagen r is worth it as compared to the volkswagen. as someone who threw thousands into a former audi, i should know. you get better brakes, better suspension, better drivetrain and tuning. most importantly, many of the engine components are beefed up and forged; so you can still tune your volkswagen r safely to 350 hp +/- for very little money. whereas running 300 or more hp on a regular volkswagen by matching the turbo in the volkswagen r works, but can start to take away your durability and reliability. also, the r is 3rd generation haldex awd."

my wife just got a volkswagen sel 4-motion, and it's pretty darn good and loaded. i'd say it's overpriced, but not with a giant discount we were able to negotiate. it was based on the ""costco"" deal, which is super aggressive, and i was happy having it matched. some dealerships wouldn't ""match it"" and claimed there were probably ""catches"" to it. other than having to listen to (waste time) the finance guy sales spiel trying to sell warranty on a 6 year 72k bumper to bumper warranted car, not really any ""catches"" at all."

,,"i'm so far beyond biased, it makes everything i say possibly specious -- but i remain, after all, ""often wrong, but never uncertain"" -- but here goes:

audi -- if you hold much stock in cr has moved up the ""reliability"" ratings with each passing year, arriving recently as the #4 ranked vehicle with respect to reliability. i would say that cr is good at the collecting of a good sized sample which makes them a very good resource for objective data (such as reliability and one would think durability, too.) 

generally speaking, ""everyone wants to be audi"" -- or so says at least one or two ""car & driver"" type magazines when they wax poetic about auto brands in recent months.

remarkably too, audi's car keep coming in close to the top or at the top of the heap in comparison tests. most recently the audi 3.0t schooled its most worthy competition and even beat the new cts (and the cts's target was the bmw 5, which, in this case it did beat -- but so did the mercedes-benz benz in the test.)

since everything does go in cycles, i would say, even with my considerable bias, ""this can't last."" now is the time to make a move and get the audi before it begins what -- eventually -- will be ""slippage."" moreover, if you want something that has been modified and modified and slightly refreshed (last year) meaning it is perhaps the ""best one ever,"" i would think you would be hard pressed to build a better mousetrap than a 2014 audi or s4. now, i may eat my words, but my '14 s4 is an absolute joy to drive. it is damn near a ""masterpiece.""

how i hope that the s4 may be tested (as was the bmw 3) against everyone's favorite newcomer -- the lexus is 350 f-sport (my first choice in this class when i thought the s4 would be out of reach financially.)

in any case, the new infiniti seems to have missed the mark if you believe at least 3 auto enthusiast magazines and cr, so your choices are somewhat limited unless you want to re up for a new (last my) g37x/sport.

now may be the time ""to audi.""

but, like i said, i'm biased -- often wrong, just not uncertain.

the infiniti is coming out this fall. same car, smaller ~220hp engine. the base model should be in the $27-28k range(msrp at $29-30k would be my guess, invoice closer to $27k). finding a program/dealer car a few months old for $25k should be possible. that is, if you can wait 5-6 months.

and, yes, the automatic tames it quite a bit. it drives more like a 5 series or e class than a z. (that said, yes, it will make scenery go by very, very fast.)

there are pictures online but nissan is keeping very mum about the car. my guess is that they want the competition to get theirs out first and under-cut them. i'd suspect that they are worried about the is250 and the new buick, though the buick is out now, so we might expect a major announcement sometime soon.

edit:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nissan_skyline
it's sold as the skyline 250gt(same exact car as the infiniti, essentially) and is currently on sale in japan. 

the combined fuel economy for the car (testing comes from singapore, of all places) lists it as roughly 24-25mpg combined, with a highway figure of close to 35mpg. one site in japan lists it as getting 38mpg in a test, but that was on a track under controlled conditions. 

and it should weigh about 3250lbs - about 300lbs lighter than the infiniti. this will make it a great car among people who like mountain roads, since the only complaint with the infiniti/z370 is its weight is a bit more than you'd like for serious mountain roads.

infiniti 5.6 seconds.
infiniti 7.0 seconds. (that's about a second faster than the is250 and buick)

it's not stupidly fast, but it certainly isn't a slouch, either. getting that type of performance out of a tiny engine like that is amazing, really.

there's no going wrong with either of the engines available in the 2007 bmw 3 series. the standard, normally aspirated engine is a little light on low-end torque, but it moves the car around smartly and provides slightly better mileage. the new twin-turbo engine provides the kind of acceleration formerly associated with the high-performance bmw, launching the bmw coupe and sedan to 60 mph in close to 5 seconds flat. no matter which model you choose, the 3 series' world-class suspension, steering and brakes will provide hours of entertainment on twisty two-lane highways. beyond simply feeling rock-solid when hustled around turns, this car communicates with the driver in a manner that inspires confidence no matter what kind of driving you're doing. at the same time, the 3 series is an ideal long-distance chrysler, delivering both a comfortably controlled ride and a quiet cabin environment.[unquote]

,,"kyfdx said:plenty of people ""settle"" for honda and toyota, because they don't see the value in the luxury makes, not because they can't afford it.. it's just not important to them.
the above is the spirit and some of the actual words i wrote. most of us have to make choices -- a new fill-in-the blank appliance, car, house, sofa, tv and so on. more important than ""things"" are the other choices we make -- perhaps it is children, college funds (for your kids or for your mba or jd or whatever). the thing is very few of us can ""have it all."" and, even some who literally could have it all, don't want it all. my best friend worked hard at a manufacturing company and eventually became the president of the company -- he never, in his entire life, has owned a new car. he searches -- it seems like all the time, to me -- for the ""cherry"" car. he finds the mythical little old lady or little old man who has a 2005 cadillac with 15,000 original miles on it and that's what he goes for. he is as passionate about car -- subscribes to all of the magazines -- as i am. this guy knows chapter and verse specs about new car, yet is always driving a car over 5 years old. 

his ""settling"" on these rare cream puff car allows him to spend lots of time on the west coast of florida on a houseboat, sailing, fishing and sitting in the sun drinking a cold beer.

whenever i get a new car, i take it to him and we go out for a long test drive -- with him behind the wheel. i can tell he loves the car and probably he hopes that when i get rid of it, he can be the next owner.

my wife and i work (long hours, typically), enjoy fine dining, wine, european travel and ellps car. we probably could afford (that is the deal could be done) for an audi rs7 ($120,000 msrp). we'd have to settle on other things were we to go for the rs. 

instead we decided to set our sites on far less expensive car (mine was $57k, hers $65k), we bought hers and leased mine. the burden for both is $1,400 per month, all in. 

our next door neighbor has a new 750 bmw -- and a toyota -- the bimmer costs as much as both of our car combined. the guy across the street has a hyundai and a yukon but also owns 1/5th of an airplane. we're all settling in our own ways. car are, for me, slowly, very slowly, beginning to be less important to me at 63 than they were when i was 50. my wife, oddly, seems to be picking up the slack -- wanting the highest hp she can get (within reason, of course).

applying for a credit check -- especially without your knowledge would not be a good practice.

i have a friend who took his 996 turbo to over 600hp/650 ft lbs at the wheels through a porsche approved tuner as well. the car has been timed at under 10 seconds in the quarter mile, putting him a few tenths and a couple million dollars ahead of a bugatti veyron, so yes, i understand the economics. i just still don't see you acknowledging the increased engine wear factor - whether or not that is of importance to you, it will be to many."

pretty darn consistent at the top right behind lexus for luxury makes the last 5 years or so. still, not at lexus reliability levels yet (or ever). 

i think we all saw cadillac tumbling coming based on @graphicguy experiences. unlike some that write-off personal experiences reported here as anecdotal, i take it to likely be ""par"" for the course as that is statistically most likely to happen. bmw's improvement is both significant and recent. they weren't that hot in prior years. 

kia has been inching toward the top for awhile now too. one of the reasons i got one, as they surpassed honda and acura for a few years now. audi's qc is most definitely superior to volkswagen's. has been for a long time, and most audi's are still made in europe while volkswagen's in mexico. 

as to chrysler's improvement, they had no where to go but up. 


so his experience with audi didn't count? 

well, i didn't have much experience with audi, except my late dad's 2004 audi tdi (in poland) that's still with the family, but enough people complained about it even on edmund's forums, like gg's infamous s4 problem and inept response from the service departments (this was before his even more disastrous cts when the service guy blamed ""wrong gas"" for for problem with the entertainment system). btw, i have to say from years of posting, gg looks like a magnet for bad car. 

i'm sure audi improved, i just found very surprising that they are now at top 3. btw, i was happy to see bmw also climbing to near top. i wonder if audi will offer similar warranty to volkswagen (6/72 btb!), or perhaps they're doing well enough and volkswagen is just putting a last ditch effort to salvage the market."

it appears the actions being taken may actually have the opposite effect -- at least that seems to be one of the outcomes that could happen.

here in cincinnati, where the chevrolet used to be produced, the gm union workers went on strike and kept squeezing and squeezing gm. gm responded by saying, ""if you keep doing this, we'll have to shut the plant down here in norwood.""

then ""all of a sudden"" gm says, ""we can't make a go of it here anymore"" -- and ""all of a sudden"" the union, in response, threatened productivity.

too little, too late.

this account is a summary, is incomplete and is somewhat light on the facts, since it was certainly not solely the union that killed gm here in cincinnati (hamilton, oh and norwood, oh.)

the downside for valentine, they only have one product, their detector. escort has several versions of their detectors, as well as some commercial radar engineering they do for others.

two really good products in their field (escort, valentine) that duke it out. you use either one the way they tell you to use it, you won't get a ticket (unless you get caught with instant one laser when no one is travelling in front of you). or, they clock you from the air (which is the only time i've been caught speeding).

,,"this is not directly related to ellps, but many people here expressed their admiration, or at least interest in diesel-powered car. i just read an article that essentially vindicates my diesel position. european union is changing its stance on diesel emissions. up to now, they were giving diesels essentially free pass, or forbearance on tested emission levels. their current testing procedures measure unrealistically low levels emission (it is by setup) and those levels are used in certification process. moreover, those unrealistic values look better than gasoline engines. this is similar to old epa highway gas mileage, when those high numbers were obtained by running car on a sunny day, with no wind, super even speed in an oval track, with a skinny driver behind the wheel, everything taken from the trunk, tire pressure set up at above normal levels, etc. moreover, the carbon emission fetish (which was huge in europe way before our administration caught the bug) lead to additional forbearance on nitrogen oxide, which is much more toxic to humans in immediate effect. carbon is supposedly bad for the planet, so we have to prevent ourselves from being drowned in oceans, or suffering other horrible ""inconvenient truth"" death scenario due to temperatures raising by 2 degrees, but nitrogen oxide killing us before then was apparently ok. this whole setup was to made diesels look much better than they really were, and as such they were taxed at lower levels. all politics.

the regulators are looking now to made all emission testing realistic and using those values for certification process. the situations is reportedly so bad that, if implemented immediately, multiple models would have to be withdrawn from the market, which tells you how much skewed the setup was. thankfully, united states government never bought into that diesel bs to the same degree. i also recall the difficulties with ""clean diesel"" implementation initiative (e.g. navistar having to pay huge penalties on their engines because they couldn't make them compliant on time), i suspect part of that was that there was no forbearance on the testing. 

i always maintained that europeans bought diesels not by choice, but because they were made by artificial market setup. also, american ""resistance"" to diesel was not as ""irrational"" as many people would try to make us believe. there is surely place for those engines - in agriculture, construction, heavy and midsize transportation, buses, perhaps on suv-level. i think diesel chevrolet, ford, or even bmw x5 (or honda honda, if they made it) make perfect sense. if you have three kids and like taking long road trips, diesel would should advantages, my problem was with worshiping tdi jettas and volkswagen. they may be fine, but i would still take a gasoline engine every day and twice on sunday."

my point is, us based consumers think they want diesel because they see them in europe and assume that's what old world people want. all i'm saying, popularity of diesel there is artificially stimulated by public policy, taxation and other incentives. anybody, who enjoyed american-market based ellps, would never even consider a diesel, except perhaps commercial vehicles, like taxi cabs and such. moreover, the traditional advantages of diesels are going away. bottom line - still clacking engine, less so than before, but more upfront cost, more maintenance, more prone to failures, sensitive to fuel quality, who knows if will last as long as older generations."

if, however, by july of 2021 acura has an electric car that has an msrp of maybe $38k it might make sense. first, my guess is that unlike a tesla that goes for full msrp you might get a discount on an electric acura. and then you'd get the federal tax credit of $7500 that has already almost expired for tesla. between the two of those things it might make sense for me to go electric—if it's acura or honda.

so if you want a lexus, go buy one... if you want a bigger car with more rear room, buy a toyota and save yourself roughly 2k, since the lexus dealer doesn't normally make deals on their car

btw, the last generation es was a tart up toyota which was 10-15k less then a es."
,,"bmw, i think you need to reread what was written, ""with all the hype the ats has had, the ats better come out swinging, and swing hard."" the objective data that has been pointed out, with a car that makes more hp then bmw, one would assume the ats would be faster. subjective, the ats is not faster. again, i hope the ats is a winner, competition only makes things better. 

with 30+ more hp and less weight then a bmw why isn't the ats faster? is bmw underrating the 2l turbo motor or is gm overrating the ats engine? 

when a car is driving on a track this does not relate to real world driving experience, since the surface of the track is ultra smooth. having a rental of the same car give a real work driving experience, remember, the rental car is usually the mid-line model, not the over the top end version that car mags get. like graphic, having rented some car have saved me some mistakes, the cts would have been one of them. the new chrysler is another perfect example, i was not that impressed with the first gen, the second gen i like a lot, easier to see traffic lights and the fit and finish is much better, i wouldn't have known this if i had not rented the car. the v6 with the 8 spd transmission is a great combo, this is one car i agree with the auto mag's."

,,"here is some news. i could not tell if some of the models will be applicable and perhaps some of the future names could be part of the ellps category. it just goes to show the continued muddied direction that boggles the mind!

if you liked alphabet soup as a kid, make an appointment at your cadillac dealer for three to five years from now. that's because gm has recently trademarked several new nameplates for cadillac, and so far we're worried and a bit confused.

at present, these names are trademarked in europe and canada. however, companies often register their trademarks in foreign markets first, and later in the united states.

this potential new naming system is undoubtedly complicated, but we will try and lay it out in the simplest way possible. so far, gm has trademarked:

 * dt7
 * ct6
 * ct5
 * bt3
 * at1
 * dtx
 * ctx
 * btx

we suspect the numbers in each name signifies each vehicle's overall size.

the ""dt7"" might be the eventual dts replacement, for example. this large, luxury sedan may end up riding on the zeta chassis in a few years time.

the ct6 and ct5 would be some kind of variants of the car we currently know as the cts. one possibility is the numbers indicate two possible wheelbase lengths. on the other hand, we can't rule out the ""5"" and ""6"" being the current cts sedan and forthcoming cts coupe.

the bt3 could represent the next-generation bls. this vehicle would probably be on the epsilon ii chassis, however, with gm's plans on the new alpha chassis being unclear, there is always a possibility bt3 could be an alpha car.

the at1 is still a bit of a mystery. that said, it's a safe bet that this would be a small car that is definitely based on the alpha chassis gm is currently developing. could it be a competitor to the bmw 1-series?

the ""x"" car will more than likely denote crossover or wagon vehicles. however we'd also leave open the option that the ""x"" indicates all-wheel-drive models.

if the crossover assumption is true, the dtx is probably the vehicle currently known as the brx. the ctx could be the forthcoming cts wagon, and the btx remains a mystery.

of course, the all-wheel-drive option is also a strong possibility. the ctx could be an awd ct6 or ct5, while the dtx would be an awd dt7, and so on.

obviously there is one glaring part of cadillac's lineup not mentioned here &#151; the escalades. some might suggest that the ""x"" vehicles we just talked about are in fact the trucks. however, given what our sources say, we don't think that's the case.

that leaves a few options. one being that gm just hasn't gotten around to coming up with new names. another being that the true cadillac trucks will not be part of this new scheme and continue on with regular names. with the marketing power the cadillac name carries, we think the latter is more likely. :confuse:

there is another type of discussion we have here constantly - does filltheblank belong to ellps? honestly, i don't really understand why people get so worked up if it does, or does not. many people would cross shop car that are not the same ""category"", so what... the line will always be blurred and they move. yesterday's luxury is today's standard. yesterday's benchmark of sportiness (like manual transmission) is becoming so rare that it's impossible to use as an actual measuring stick. prices go up incessantly, so yesterday's 30k car is today's 40k. and so on. if somebody cross shops ford ford st or subaru subaru/sti with bmw bmw and somebody else cross-shops lexus es (not even is) with same bmw, who am i to say they are ""wrong"" about looking at them? they'll choose what they like at the end, it may not be ellps, but who cares.

while i agree with a lot of what you say, your implication in the bolded text is not entirely correct. there are reasons that those badges have certain reputations. as a former audi owner and a current acura owner, i can tell you that the acura has been a lot more reliable than the audi. but do you know what? i miss the audi. it inspired more passion as its interior was nicer, its handling was better, and it was more solid. but it was less reliable and cost a lot more to fix. sit in a mercedes-benz benz and then sit in an acura. can you feel the difference? i can.

when i owned an audi (not that bad for repairs and reliability) i wished for a very reliable japanese car.

i like the infiniti but would get it in ""x"" form because of winter traction. if i bought a tl, the front wheel drive would be adequate without having to jump up in price. don't really care about the extra hp or being able to take hairpins at speed. your car buying criteria may be different than others looking at the same class of auto....nothing wrong with that. so it is not wrong to cross shop the acura with the bmw 3, it is completely right for many people.

i was in the exact same situation as you about half a year ago. my parents have reached the age where they can get us kids to to the shopping and testing for them.(though we have kids as well - heh). cpo 1-2 years old was also an option. 

anyways, the short list was the acura, the c class, the cts, the infiniti, and the is250/350.

acura - this came in last place. it suffers from front wheel drive and while it is pretty inside, it still has a noisy engine and a feel to it that is pretty ""normal"". and the looks aren't that great. it has that smiley face look that only the japanese can pull off. 

is250/350 - had a lot of the same issues as the acura. just sort of ""meh"", though a very nice and pretty car overall. but it lacked something identifiable as a soul or a personality. like going to cold stone and getting just vanilla ice cream. sure, it's superb, but even the most awesome vanilla is still vanilla. the prices of the acura and is also seemed a bit inflated. 

so that left the infiniti, pontiac, the c350, and the cts. 

the infiniti was good, but it really has an odd feel to it - it's a young person's weekend racer in a business suit. it doesn't feel as polished or refined as it should be, and perhaps that's because it is based upon the z. it also has that dolled-up feel to it. i guess it was sitting in the m next to it that reinforced to me how big of a difference there was between luxury and just looking like it. you''d figure that an auto manufacturer would build a smaller version of its better car instead of pimping out a lower brand...

great car to drive, though. just was missing something.... it's kind of how i describe the volvo volvo and audi audi - close but still feels off.

it boiled down to two choices that were an absolute tie, the c class and the cts. 

the cts was what they eventually settled upon, but only because of the gm dollars that he had. it is a fantastic car all-around. the car drives great, handles great, and has a very nice interior. it's by far the best thing gm has ever made. 

my personal favorite, though, was the (new model) c350. it felt just about perfect in how it drove. the interior was also perfect as well - great seat, and you could tell that it was really a smaller version of the e class and s class. i'd rate it as a slightly softer road feel of the 3 series. both are within a few percent of each other. but the edge for luxury goes to mercedes-benz benz. the edge for performance goes to bmw.

why is that? are the fines from speeding higher than from passing on the right infractions? wait, wait, don't answer that, yet: if the speeding fines are, for example, $100, then passing on the right fines ought to be $250 -- you would think once the word got out that such infractions would sharply shrink.

i'm one of the people that thinks you should either take laws off the books that are routinely ignored or that the infraction fines should be made proportionate to the potential bodily and property damage that such infraction, if ignored, suggests. and, then, of course, enforce them.

to be completely fair, the slushbox on the bmw loaner, i had for couple of weeks came, close to what i'd consider acceptable replacement. it was really first premium segment car i had opportunity to drive for more extended time and i almost liked the transmission. i opted for the manual simply because it was possibly last chance i still had an option(same with the six-in-line engine, btw). 

i'm resigned to strong possibility of getting a slushbox for my next car - hopefully long time from now. it's not going to be ""terrible"", or anything like that - just a little sad, that's all. end of an era. but since there was a stay of the execution, i used it."

,,"markcincinnati said:the ats sales are particularly disappointing. 
nearly negative 40 percent is a disaster, considering that ats didn't even reach its midcycle upgrade and their initial stated goals for the volumes. ats was supposed to capture the fallout of cts sticker shock, but it seems it did no such thing - people simply walked away completely, they didn't get cts and they didn't get ats, either. 

i wonder if that's just cadillac's hubris, or a real strategy. for years good old gm was losing money on every car they sold and ""making up in volume"" , but that ""strategy"" was a road to bankruptcy. perhaps they decided to simply acknowledge they can't sell as many car as before, but through product improvement, they can reach some sustainable level of sales, albeit lower than before. one possibility is, if they are truly capable of having superior product and financially ready to back up lower volumes, they may attempt to hop over germans, who are going in an opposite direction, by making their brand more accessible. how difficult is that? extremely. even if they can make a product that beats the germans, the logistical problem are multifold - their dealer network is too big for the lower volumes of ""exlusive brand"", they would have to let go many (which costs money in broken contracts), they will need to shutter or repurpose plants (which costs money) and the risk is the downward spiral may still continue (people see sales falling so they don't wont to join the ""losers"" club). the previous gm had completely gutless management and militant unions, which made any real downsizing impossible. not sure if the current one can pull it off - perhaps they can. the road to brand rebuild is long and twisted.

cadillac has been a ""volume premium"" brand for many decades now. it was ""super rich"" brand only at its inception. by the time around 50s -60s it was a car not just for a millionaire, but also for the local dentist and lawyer. it meant higher prices than popular car, but low enough so every midsize town could have a cadillac dealership. it's not like jaguar, where they always were a niche player with small network, except failed rebadge ford mondeo experiment. today they seem content with small market segment with very expensive product. cadillac is simply too big for that. they need volumes. i think it's basically a failure from the sales point of view, even if the products (cts and ats) are best they have ever been."

1. quiet smooth ride. dampen road noise.

2. luxury cabin and modern amenities. i.e. soft leather, no cheap materials and someplace to plug my ipod in.

3. power and performance. doesnt have to smoke everyone on the road or corner on rails but when i need to pass it should respond impressively.

4. back seat capable of fitting a car seat and an adult if needed.

5. drivable in bad weather. i wont say absolutely no rear wheel drive but i have previously owned an infiniti g-35 coupe and it was nearly useless in even a light snowfall and not good in the rain.

6. sporty style. this is subjective obviously 

so. i am thinking:

2006 bmw 325xi or a 2006 acura tl

other candidates are the audi audi/audi, volvo volvo or mercedes-benz benz c class.

,,"perhaps you're right, but vag's 1.9tdi (previous gen 4-cylinder diesel) was a highly acclaimed motor, a special favorite in high-mileage used car markets, like my old country's (poland). my dad's is abot 100k miles, which is nothing for those engines. granted, that engine is also an older-generation, developed prior common rail technology. it is known for high durability and good resistance to abuse due to substandard fuels and hard working conditions. all great, but the price was noise, vibrations and short torque curve.

the new enviro-friendly diesels are known for overcoming many of those issues (lower noise, not as much vibrations, better power delivery), but the price paid is steep - high maintenance and much reduced durability. so, if having to choose between noisy durable diesel, or quiet fragile diesel, i choose gasoline engine. 

i think many americans confuse marriage of reason between europeans and diesel with some kind of love without limits. europeans opt for diesels mostly because their governments push them to do so by taxes on both vehicles and fuel and because diesels to get better gas mileage. in the world of fuel priced at $6-8, a lawn mower may be attractive for people mover."

my expectation is that the tl replacement (tlx?) will be introduced very early in calendar year 2014 as a 2015 model. 

the recently announced 2013 tl special edition model (a 2013 model being introduced in june 2013 makes me wonder if there will be an official 2014 model) is the the kind of ""high value"" upgrade done to generate sales in a model's last days. the sticker price is only $1500 more than the 'base' tl, but it adds-

ebony leather interior with contrast stitching
18"" 10-spoke chrome-look alloy wheels
keyless access system w/ push-button ignition
body-colored decklid spoiler
special edition badging

you mentioned the freedom that your 93 newport gave you. i too felt that my 72 cutlass gave me freedom. but we grew up in a much smaller world. cases in point:

before i had a grown up job, i had been on one plane trip. i can't count the number of times my kids have been on plane trips. my 15 yo daughter is going on 3 of them in the next 12 months and none of them is with family. 

we had 3 channels on tv - if your family was rich and had uhf tv, you might have 5. 

we had one avocado green rotary phone in the kitchen and we didn't make long distance calls. i remember my parents calling the operator to schedule a time for an overseas line to call family for a few expensive minutes of conversation.

on sundays we went to church then went to our cousin's house for a late lunch and a day of fun or the beach for an all day outing involving lots of water, sand, and sunburns.

we would go on vacation to the beach two hours away and know nothing of what was going on at home.

kids today - i can't believe i just said that - have the world at the fingertips and that is their freedom. the don't need a car to take them away.

,,"i find it -reasonable- to assume buick has a high reliability ranking because 'old' people aren't tearing it up like a younger person would; same with lexus. 
____>>>>>>>>>>)))))))))

i don't agree with those presumptions though. a decently made vehicle will stay in one piece whether you drive it like grandpa or you drive it like you stole it (as long as you maintain it properly). for instance.... my '95 neon fell apart when it was babied, and it tore apart equally as bad when i drove it like a teenager should (:p).

my friend of the same age literally raped his '95 geo prism (a toyota under the emblem) day after day, from birth until he sold it at over 100k miles. while he treated his toyota at least 10x harsher than i treated my neon, i needed 4 tow trucks in 65k miles while his car needed zero in over 100k miles. he had zero mechanical issues (someone did break off his rearview mirror though (but that's rough housing negligence, not the car fault).

with rev limiters in automatics... if the car can't be driven like it can be driven, then maybe the manufacturer should move the red line to 2,500 rpm???? i can't imagine any kind of driving style (short of willful attempts to destruct) hampering the life of a well made vehicle (accidents excluded).

in conclusion if a car self destructs just because you don't drive it like someone over 65, then that car should be labeled as a disposable vehicle. like a bic disposable razor. planned obsolesense?

another example, i've tracked my audi several times (and driven it way harder in general than any other car i've owned, including the neon as a teenager). the audi has been fairly reliable almost to the level of the honda i owned for 65k miles (which was far from perfect, but very good; i blame ohians for most of the issues). none of the issues with my audi that have hit my pocket book could really be reasonably attributed to driving it ""hard,"" other than routine maintenance items like brake pads, rotors, and tires. costs in those areas are high when you drive it like it was meant to be driven.

p.s. it wouldn't suprise me that much if an audi made post 2000 was more reliable than a honda made post 2007. was the honda made in the usa?; even less surprising then. now if your honda was made in japan, and the audi beat it... congratulations to audi! but audi is reliable enough for the last 10 to 12 years that any one good one could perhaps beat a bad honda by a bit."

granted, you might say the v6 chevrolet with an automatic transmission isn't gm's front running ""track car,"" but neither is the '06 audi for audi, and it never went into limp mode at low miles or being left unmodified. even modified and higher miles it usually only happened at temps above 90 degrees. 

now why would gm make car that so easily are put into ""limp"" mode? the answer lies in previous model year rental camaros likely blowing brand new transmissions and spewing fluid on the track. solution to most car companies would be to build a better more reliable durable car with a better transmission. solution for gm (post bk by the way) was to apparently create and/or lower threshold of going into limp mode. fail.

he sidelined my s4 with less than a month to go for a track weekend, a track weekend i didn't want to miss being that i had missed the previous one with the club for other reasons. 

hertz (insurance rental) didn't do me any favors, in fact, they pretty much sabotaged my plans, and nearly (after over 3 weeks advance warning and notice) put me in a buick buick. given the choice between a chevrolet rs v6 and the buick, well, it was no choice at all. really, they should have saved the c250 mercedes-benz benz for me. most people at the track said a ford would have been more fun to drive. i didn't end up having much fun, as the chevrolet is too heavy. next time i'll specify a ford."

but what still gets my undies in a crunch is people around here directly comparing the cts to the bmw 3 series. oh sure cadillac wouldn't mind some 3-seried buyers cross shopping since they don't have a car in that space (in america) and probably won't for another 2 years. but it's completely unfair to compare the cts to a smaller, lighter vehicle.

bmw bmw
wheelbase: 108.7""
length: 178.2""
width: 71.5""
curb weight: 3593 lbs
epa class: compact

the bmw bmw has a wheelbase 5 inches shorter on average and about a foot in total length shorter than all the above mentioned vehicles. it's interior size is a whole 'nother epa category. bottom line is that the cts is the new bmw/mercedes-benz benz competitor to this space. get used to it. it's just that the old competitor in this class for caddy (the sts) hasn't died yet. but cadillac has already publically stated that the sts (and dts) will die in favor of a new large flagship car, while a smaller ""b-series"" car will slot under the cts in the next couple of years.

yes the cts is on the heavy side and that's been a problem for gm's sigma platform in general. in this class, only the infiniti m35 weighs a tick more. but they got so many other parts of the car right. yes, entry to the backseat is cramped, but frankly, i don't have rear passengers often unless they are my kids.

the cts is now missing a couple of major features to properly compete in this space: a v8 engine option that's not a hot-rod (a la m-series/amg/s & rs-class/v-series). i fully expect gm to retify that situation when the next-gen northstar appears in a year or two. with a new cts-v also due on the horizon, that means the sts can be put out to pasture. the second major issue is body styles. i already know a wagon is in the works and a coupe should be coming at some point."

if you run it like you stole it and have a manual, it'll last about twice as long. if you put racing oil in it, you'll likely be fine as that's close to euro standards. american oil is also far to low ppm zinc to give any level of fallback if the engine starts to wear out.

according to independent analysis, they are rated for 90% reliability at 90k miles. at a constant speed of 60mph. yes, that means you can expect 10% of the bearings to fail by 90k miles. and if you run it faster than that, it'll wear out faster. if you run low ppm oil in it or don't change it regularly, it'll wear out faster. if you lug the engine or have an automatic, it'll also wear out faster.

the bearings are garbage and essentially need to be replaced like a timing belt at 60-70k miles to be safe. 

at $2500 cost. (10 hours labor plus $900 in parts last i checked, plus tax.) quite a steep ""service item"". to top it all off, they look at you like you are daft if you question this logic. i mean, the first 15k mile service cost a mere $500 (a couple of rounds of volkswagen), so why are you complaining about a $2500 bearing change every 4 or 5 years?

 the dealer experience in reading above posts seems like a big deal- im about price - how much can i get into and out of a car not which has a latte machine. i would rather not be in a dealer at all- knock on wood i wont be again for anything other than a $300 oil change. but i can see @graphic_guy_ frustration given his unreal experience. i also like the fact he's friends with sweeneybmw which if i was shopping for a bmw no better place then sweeney.
sween....you and i agree (o.m.g..... . wife being in an honda, i'm beginning to see the honda engineering in a lower priced car vs the acura counterparts. i drove the tlx. nice car. not the same driving experience as the tl-s models or even the sh awd tl that i had. admittedly, i like the look of the new one better than the old one, but didn't have an issue with the ""beak"" look that others did. 

truth told, if audi had just fixed my s4, i'd still be in the fold. instead, they lost me. i have to believe i'm smack dab in the wheelhouse of their demographic, too.

bang for the buck, an s4 is hard to beat.

but, as these things go, every body is stealing from everyone else. my cts awd has the trick torque vectoring rear that the audi audi and acura tl sh awd have. my cts has the twin scroll turbo that the bmw 4 cyl has (and more power to boot). get the v-sport (last year could be had for high $40s). and you get the 6 cyl with two turbos...wicked fast.

took a couple of weeks, but once i got used to cue, i ""get it"". and, i like it. my understanding is they went through a couple of interim updates to get it to this point, though.

acura needs that turbo motor. otherwise, stick with a honda.

the honda and honda are great car. are their acura counterparts worth $x,ooo more? it's not clear cut. so i guess that's pretty telling.

that said, i loved all the acura i've had. not sure they shouldn't just go ahead and just be an upscale suv brand and be done with it. maybe they're hoping the new honda will breathe life into their car sales. the acura and the tlx both need that turbo 4, though. the tlx, in particular, looks like a took a step back going from the sweet 3.7l in the previous gen sh awd version to the 3.5l in the current car. not sure what the thought process was there. in the tech dept, where they used to be at the forefront, they're now lagging behind, even with a totally new refresh.

btw....here's my bmw dealer......http://www.sweeneybmw.com/index.htm


fn....if the prospect of getting $15k+ off a cts wasn't out there, no way i would have entered the cadillac showroom. my issues with cadillac came before the gm ""purge"". i think the cadillac dealers had to get into shape or the prospect of gm cutting them became quite real. that was very evident in my experiences with the same dealership 11 years ago, and the experience with them now. truly, it was a night and day difference. 

drove the ats. thought it was a really fun car. a tad small for my tastes (reminded me of the audi, sidewise). drove the cts, and had as much fun, only with all the trappings of an e class, audi, 5 series......a better suspension than any of those, with better steering, braking, etc. a cadillac....right? who'd have thunk it.

frankly, if i didn't get such a good deal on the cts, i would have been targeting an is350 f-sport, probably this summer. that's a fun car, too. a little on the snug side (and i'm not a big guy)."

having driven a q40 in it's former infiniti guise and owning a 2015 subaru 2.5i premium, i can tell you that these are 2 completely different vehicles. i can offer you a few pieces of advice. 1st, if you like the way the subaru drives, then stay away from the infiniti dealership. just thinking about the 153 horsepower difference makes me want to head down to my local infiniti dealer and see if i can trade in and break even on my subaru (13k miles since 9/27/2015). power from the q40's 328hp v6 is plentiful while i'd describe my subaru's power output adequate. 

the subaru will definitely be roomier inside. the interior is very well finished with high quality, soft touch materials everywhere. the subaru will ride smoother. i got my subaru before the eyesight was available. i originally wanted it the package is somewhat of a bargain at only $1200 or so, but i couldn't wait. i've also read that depending on your market, eyesight equipped car are selling closer to sticker than non eyesight equipped car. i really like the 18"" wheels on the subaru limited. i have cloth seat, but have driven a subaru with leather and it was very nice.
thanks a lot. you mentioned extra horsepower is a plus for q40/infiniti... to me that is a secondary since i should have to pay more for gas on q40. its mpg is low. is there any other plus in q40 compared with subaru that you can imagine ? 


basically power, performance, & handling are the q40's major advantages. it's all what you put stock in. i happen to like all that stuff, but didn't exactly have the budget when the lease was up on my 2011 bmw 328xi. i also do a lot more driving than average (over 20k per year), so leasing gets pricey."

there are people out there who have the mindset that a car payment is like another monthly bill. they like the smell of a new car every 2-3 years. if they are going to pay $500 a month (on a 60 month loan) for a loaded camcord, then they might as well pay $600 a month (i'm just throwing this number out there) for a $45 - $50k bmw on a lease."

it's all instant gratification. when i ordered my bmw sportswagon for ed followed by performance center delivery (yes, you can combine the two), many people at work could not understand why i would wait for a car for four month, just to get it right. isn't that easier to go there and just get a red one off the lot? they're asking. well, yes, but to me a deal on something you don't really want is not a deal at all."

your original list immediately shrinks to this. lexus is largely bland, souless junk. (two exceptions though - i'll get to them in a bit). infiniti is great. the infiniti dodge is fantastic. and, honestly, none of the awd system in car unless they are 100% full-time engaged actually work in bad weather. it's pure marketing and smoke and mirrors. so either get a 4x4 vehicle or something like a subaru that has full-time 4 wheel drive. or just get a 2wd vehicle and save money. note - this also gets you 2-5mpg back.

interesting that you say that the new 2009 acura is small - it's much larger than the older one and i thought it would be a perfect fit.

anyways - the reason you consider domestic vehicles is because they depreciate quickly and yet are solidly engineered. i can guarantee that 95%+ of the people on this forum can't begin to reach the limits of a first generation cts, let alone something like a infiniti. 

so, the two lexus exceptions you should look at:
the is300 was perhaps the closest thing japan ever made to a 3 series in terms of getting that small european sport sedan feel. they also are one of the least expensive luxury sport sedan ever made in terms of repairs and upkeep. i'd look at one - and actually drive it before you pass on it, because it is a great car to drive. i'd also say the same thing about a 2007 cts - drive it and then decide if it's bad or not. 

the other one is a 2005 lexus gs300. what makes this car special is that it is rwd and has a 3.0l inline 6 engine. as a result, it has great reliability, smoothness, power, and does it while getting good mpg. there's a reason bmw and uses inline 6 engines, and lexus got it exactly right with both the is300 and the gs300(same engine, btw, in both).

why did they change? they worshiped hp and marketing more than building a perfect compromise. then again, to be honest, both designs are dated compared to the cts, which was a real game changer. 

other than that, you're looking at a volvo or maybe a suv. the reality is fo rused car:

japan - reliable, expensive to fix, costly to buy used.(depreciate too slowly)
gm - less reliable, inexpensive to fix, reasonably priced.(depreciate normally)
bmw/mercedes-benz benz/audi - terrible reliability, insane to fix, reasonably priced.(depreciate like a rock)"
,,"i think you answered your own question. scope them all out, see which ones interest you enough to get into a short term relationship with, then go where the money trail leads.

the 3 isn't the car for people looking for a fun, small, nimble rwd coupe. i had one...it didn't fit the bill. 

i'm not bashing the 318ti. i just don't think it compares well to the 1 series.
price is going to be a factor even tho some factor in eliteness. i maintain my guesses for pricing but that's for base msrp. what you can get the car for is another matter with too many variables. let's see how well bmw does at selling the 1 series at a high price point. honda sells more honda which sticker out about that price yet sell for considerably less. but of course the honda is a huge car.
the 3 series sadly is now overweight hopelessly so. great car but not what it once was. the 1 series can do a lot but not if they price it as high as car which will be more desirable to the average car buyer. i know, i know bmw isn't for everyone. but bmw wants to make money and they need new blood in the showrooms. the 1 series is small and will probably be a great car if they don't kill it with over pricing."

i'm looking for a new car in 2011 or 2012. i think the fx is the best looking suv ever made but some find it not attractive. 

speaking of sleazy salesmen, we test drove a toyota last week also. the salesman knew me somewhat for many years having sold me a toyotal supra back in the 90s. he knew that i was an informed consumer.

when we spoke about price, i mentioned that the dealership of a competing brand was cutting the holdback and crediting it to us in their price. he first said he never heard of ""holdback"" and when i chuckled he later said toyota only pays $200 for holdback.
i corrected him and informed him that the holdback was more than double that.

we walked out. you'd think that an experienced toyota salesman would have more sense and class but i guess i give some car salemen too much credit."

,,"i've come to the conclusion that the best car for the op is actually none of the above.

he wants something affordable and sporty and luxury, that's also reliable and gets good gas mileage. unfortunately, they stopped making this car 2-3 years ago, but that's fine, because used like-new examples run about $20k.

get a mercedes-benz benz c230k sedan with manual. this is the *4 door* sedan with the 1.8 supercharged engine in it. it was the exact same model that they sell in europe(slightly larger engine) and is actually fairly reliable. mercedes-benz benz makes two types of car. car and taxis/rentals. the way you can tel the difference is if it comes with stick-shift, since 90% of germans get a license that allows them to drive manuals. if you are one of the 10% that gets an automatic-only license, you are literally laughed at and considered to be a child driver.

mercedes-benz benz puts no effort into their fleet sales and models, and especially their automatic transmissions. just enough to get by and no more(s class aside of course). this is why an e class, well, *is* a taxi in 90% of the world. and it's why their suvs suck. they are made for basically u.s. markets and taxis.(see a pattern? heh)

in europe, it's all about the a, b, and c class. manuals are the norm and diesels are better. the closer mercedes-benz benz you buy to this sort of vehicle, the better it will drive and last.

in europe, it's called the c200 kompressor and is a great car. unfortunately, you have to go back to the previous generation in the u.s. to get that engine.

of course, the best mercedes-benz benz is this:
c 220 cdi 4-cylinder 190 hp 460 nm
if we got this over here, it would obliterate the entry-level segment. 460nm is an outrageous amount of torque, and 190hp is equal to the is250. all while getting 30+ mpg.

http://autocar-show.blogspot.com/2007/06/first-drive-experience-mercedes-benz benz-c220.ht- ml
bummer we can't get it here...
****

now, if you're looking for automatic(sigh), get couple of year old is300. this car has the is250's looks and feel, yet is lighter and lots more powerful, plus it has a nice i-6 engine as well. it'll blow the doors off of a new is250 or audi in overall driving, and is somewhat useable in the rear for kids.

note - while the is300 was good, it honestly reminded me exactly of the volvo 850, but with rwd instead of fwd. it had a very ""european"" feel to it. something abot the balance and suspension and size and all the rest - it felt better than the base 3 series.

the lexus messed up. they made a compromise version that's honestly not any better than the stuff gm puts out, and they put a mega-speed transmission and a v6 in the is350 in a nissan.for power, when all it did as turn it into a muscle car.

remember, the original luxury performance sedan was... a bmw 2002. light, chevrolet, and well rounded are musts. bloat, muscle-car power, and in search for a purpose... that's most modern car.

i second it and basically stated that in my posting. when a car has a repair tag of 20k which included frame (sub frame) work you are asking for issues. since the car is basically new, it would never be the same. now i don't remember, who was at fault in the accident?"

oh lord, bmw is a car company in which it needs to make money, so they build car that majority of people would buy. if bmw would go back and build just niche car they wouldn't be making any money, because people like you road don't buy enough car to keep bmw open. yes, todays 3 series, 5 series are bigger car, just like the mazda 6, toyota, audi, and c class are bigger then their last generation.

since i decided i could tolerate fwd this time around, i ended up looking at exactly those two car. since the rwd choices may improve over the next few years, i wanted something that wouldn't depreciate horribly over a 3-4 year period. i went with the acura, and that'd probably be your best bet as well -- audi depreciation is nothing to write home about. going used, as has been suggested, is the only way to keep the payment as low as you want it.

honda depreciation is amazingly low; i'm shopping for a car for my mother-in-law, and honda vs. toyota used car prices have to be seen to be believed. a 1-2 year older honda with 40-50k more miles sells for the same money as a newer much less used toyota. audi isn't even in the same ballpark.

you'll enjoy either car, by the way. the acura is working out nicely; it's meant to be an interim solution, but if i bond with it in a big way, i may still be driving it in 8 years, as i did my last car. i've driven rental a3s in europe & really loved them. i did serious audi research, going back seven years, as a result.

let us know how this turns out."
,,"european magazines have additional additional tests, not known here, such as equivalent of going from 40 to 60 mph, or 50 to 75 mph on on highest, or second highest gear to assess flexibility of the engine, as well as its performance. this was especially important for manual transmission car, to get you feel how much you need to operate that stick."
,,"if anyone was unhappy with their audi/s4 audi/sq5 audi/s5's audi connect feature due to the limitations of the t-mobile network (here in river honda at least), my dealer loaned me an at&t simm chip and coded my mmi to point to at&t rather than t-mobile and voila! i am full-time in 3g and typically with at least 3 bars.

since audi connect is used to create a wifi hot spot and to ""surf the web,"" i have found 3g to work good to very good almost all of the time. my friend's 2016 audi has 4g lte and it is even better, but google search is only a second or three slower on mine, now, than on his -- ""google search morton's of chicago"" works about the same on his as on mine.

when driving to columbus from cincinnati my colleague can be on his e-mail account and send and receive powerpoint docs as attachments with decent speed. not possible with t-mobile.

if you need to know how to do this, i'm certain i can poke around the mmi and find the secret sauce, but, you'll still need an new simm chip, and i can't help you there.

another benefit is i can use my iphone on wifi while i'm in the car, cutting my data plan overruns to practically nil.

,,"i just experienced today what it means when you buy a premium brand vehicle. well, i was prepared, as i have done my research, but still can't shake that feeling of being treated like a milking cow. so i get to this first ""free"" service that bmw tells you that ""all you pay is tires"", everything, everything is freee. yeah, right. i get my ""advisor"" (who is basically a sales person) simply print out a piece of paper with $600 ""worth"" of service they ""recommend"" and casually saying like nothing that's what they're going to do. it is:
- four wheel alignment (well, ok that may be a legitimate item for those concerned, but why isn't that covered than if all is supposed to so free, free, free): $200. what???!!!! :mad: market rate is between $50 (with coupon) and $80, i understand that's a premium place, but not at a tripple rate.
- engine induction system cleaning. yeah, right at 15k miles it's soooo dirty, especially when using a brand premium gas. i have never done one and i owned some perfomance car, like sti. no thanks. btw, price is also $200, a little over double of market.
- power steering fluid flush. really?? at 15k??? are your serious??? oh, also $200.

wow. so this is how ""free, free, super free"" service looks like - nice isn't it? absolutely ridiculous, both in terms of ""recommendations"" and prices. i wonder how many poor saps would they scare into doing this. 

i told them to jump into the lake (in much nicer words, of course), and the ""advisor"" didn't even flinch, except he told me all that story about lost goodwill at beyond warranty (yes, i do plan to keep my car for longer, at least today). but when you count all those ""recommended"" services at those highly inflated prices, it's like paying for that good will, just up front. i'll do when it comes, got enough money for that. a coworker summarized it well - she said it's basically bying a friend.

i already dread my next visit and ""advice"" at 30k. i hate those pitches. the sad part is that in the noise there can be something actually worth doing, but when you get hit for money just for the sake of it, i lose all trust to my ""advisor"" and have to work on my own what actually is worth doing and at what price."

yes, and i looked into that. it is still a big big job to do the swap. if you can find the right car from a porsche specialist or private owner who can tell you if its been done, great. i couldn't find any such vehicle in my budget, however. its just something to be aware of."

i will believe chrysler's improvement (it jumped over other domestics) if it remains there for a few years. and where is fiat? off the scale?

i distinctly remember having this discussion before. @flightnurse also has his 320i ""chipped."" it is definitely an issue that varies from dealer to dealer. if you've got a service department that is enthusiast friendly than you should be ok. if your dealership's service department is a ""by the book czar,"" then they will find the 6 degrees of separation between your leaking wiper fluid tank and your chip. once they figure it out, they will void your warranty.

i assume you mean the bmw gran coupe; it is a decent enough chrysler, but i can't saythat i like it all that much better than the b7 press loaner that i took to motorsport ranch in 2007. the competition package might make it more acceptable, but i haven't tried a car so equipped. still, at the end of the day the m235i and bmw/4 remain the only new bmw i'd seriously consider owning."
,,"long time posters here will know that i fell off the audi wagon about a year ago and went with a 2012 acura tl sh-awd advance. the car has lived up to its reputation of being ""perfect"" from a mechanical perspective -- i would assume this car would soldier on for years and years and 100's of thousands of miles with nothing but regular maintenance. this is the first car i have ever owned that seems to be deft at hiding the miles it shows on the odometer (20,000+ in 11 months). the germans i have had showed their age unless they were ""over maintained.""

in fact there has only been one -- troubling -- issue with the car. the front brakes at 8,000 miles were warped (and ""turned"" as part of the warranty.) again at 20,000 miles the tell-tale shuddering of warped rotors returned and they were again resurfaced. today, two days after the resurfacing, the brakes feel ""the way they should"" in my opinion.

while the car was in for an oil change, tire rotation and brake resurfacing, my loaner car was a 2012 tl tech. not awd, not advance -- simply a nice 3.5l fwd tl with the tech package.

previous loaners have always been new acura's -- i can't remember when i actually had driven a tl that was not awd and not advance, in fact.

to cut to the message: i get out of my tl and into the fwd tl and motor off to run errands and drive all over the honda of columbus, oh for a few hours -- my first thought within one mile, ""this car is a sofa."" had they given me a lexus instead?

ok, here's my impression -- the tl fwd falls over its tires, i.e., understeers easily, has torque steer aplenty and is unimpressive for a car that probably lists (as my loaner was) close to $40k. there is no way it belongs in any discussion -- while keeping a straight face -- called entry level luxury performance sedan. it feels like an honda or a toyota (or perhaps toyota) for pity's sake. the steering is way overboosted and there doesn't appear to be any device affixed to the thing that provides any resistance to the massive body roll and exacerbated understeer this thing is capable of demonstrating.

no wonder all the good stuff written about the tl (for 2012) is about the sh-awd advance version -- without that level of trim, the thing is practically a joke with respect to ""performance"" entry level or other-wise.

i had no idea the difference would be so pronounced.

while i was there, i looked at the new acura -- now without sh-awd (good looking, upscale honda honda, no sh-awd, what were they thinking?) and the acura -- better looking than a honda but with a puny engine and 5 speed automatic, again it makes me wonder ""what were they thinking?""

the tl, as mine is configured when driven back to back with an audi s4, made me think, the tl was (for the money) an s4-lite (or s4 like) for $11,000+ less money. 

going from the german car i have been used to in my garage since 1978 to the tl was, with this model, not terribly difficult. it does appear that acura needs to really step up its game to be in the ellps crowd. as of my day in the life this weekend, i would say acura is on probation to remain a member of this group.

,,"dino001 said:wow, what's happening? why is bmw cutting maintenance and warranty? this is effectively a price increase. looks like pushing the lease even harder than before. also seems like a very weak statement about confidence in this new and improved product. too many problem with turbo engines? hoarding cash for a future dieselgate? what gives?

i think that maintenance thing was actually a fairly strong selling point, at least to me, but it might have been too few covered services, leaving car prone to long term issues and dealers unhappy, because they were unable to upsell during those four years.
if i didn't know a great indy audi shop then i might feel differently about the value of free maintenance. also, if the car is totaled early in its life, i don't believe you get a penny for ""free maintenance"" back. so it could end up being worthless. 

i think bmw found that a few too many non-badge buyers are driving the heck out of these car, and m brakes are very expensive to service and replace (pads and rotors)."
,,"i believe you are right. when i started out, pre audi club discount, the dealer offered 5% off. the acna certificate bumped it up to 6%. the dealer discounted the audi more than 6%, so the acna discount wasn't the best deal.

my wife ordered the audi in curvee silver with the chestnut brown sport interior giving her sport seat (ahhhhhh) and the three spoke steering wheel with paddle shifters.

funny thing, the s4 s-tronic has paddle shifters but the car is smarter than most people (like me), so you're better off leaving the s-tronic to its own devices. the 8-speed tiptronic, however, only comes with paddle shifters if you get the sport interior (which is rare), and the 8-speed benefits from them.

here's one that puzzles me: why not market an audi with the same engine as the audi 3.0t (a detuned s4 supercharged affair good for 295 ft pounds of torque)?

i haven't had a speeding ticket in almost 20 years -- gulp! the s4 could easily break that streak. 

i think the s4 has ""high-def"" (is that right?) radio too; my wife's last bmw had that and it was quite enjoyable and actually had better fidelity than sat radio.

did you hear about the key fob scam the dealership and kia finance are in cahoots on? basically, the way it works is they ""doctor"" paperwork behind closed doors to show 1 key fob returned, even if you returned two. then they say the reason you weren't given a return receipt in writing on the drop off date is that the lease manager wasnt' there to do it."
,,"the reason they break down if they are not revved hard is due to a design flaw in the engines. well, it's not a design flaw, so much as that they were designed with european oils in mind that have proper levels of additives. as well as being run at higher speeds and rpms. 

when the epa forced oil companies to drop their levels of zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (usually just referred to as ""zinc"") to 1200ppm, they started to show increased wear. with the move to 800ppm, it's only a matter of time before the engine eats itself if you run it like a typical yuppie. why? the engines are designed with tight internal clearances that require high pressures to force oil into and out of the parts, especially the lower output bearings. 

you just have to learn to be happy running it at 4-5krpm all the time. yes, that means running around town in 2nd gear and making some noise. :p

http://www.lnengineering.com/ims.html
the problem with the engines in detail (ignore the hyperbole and marketing and ford on the pictures and technical parts). low rpms=early death. since the design requires higher rpms/pressure to lubricate, but oil simply starts to fail at those higher pressures that result (6000+rpm), your only fail-safe is high zinc levels. if the oil doesn't have it, well... your engine blows its bearings at 40-50k miles.

note - this affects motorcycles, rotary engines, and smaller engines like the s2000 that rev past 6k rpm routinely. normal sae approved oils won't cut it. thankfully valvoline and a few others make higher level conventional oils. most are marketed as ""high mileage"" oils. this is a nice trick, btw - always use the high mileage oil even in a new engine - as well as good conventional oil instead of synthetic if the engine does any sort of higher rpms."

,,"we've got an audi - 2006 with dsg. in terms of room it's far, far bigger inside than the lexus. we easily take 4 adults in an audi. we use it to make trips to costco, storage, etc. shockingly our 2006 has held its value really well. we paid 22k for it in march 2007 and with 27k miles it's still worth at least 21k. the engine's powerful, yet the car gets great gas mileage and the dsg is still fun to play with. it handles poorly but then again so does the lexus. 

on the downside, audi service is horrible. i had no idea how good i had it with bmw until i took our audi in for the ""free"" maintenance. one of the passenger door lock switches blistered and the rubber came off it. the scumbags at audi of america said it was a trim and normal wear piece so the warranty did not apply. they said repair of the switch would be $300. seriously, how awful is audi? my wife swore up and down, telling me she loves the car but we will never buy an audi again. a 2 year old car with a blistered door switch and it's not covered by the warranty? that's obscene - especially when it's obviously a defect, not a result of wear or tear.

the acura *is* a great car, mind you, but as the real honda, you'd expect it to be. what we get as the ""honda"" over here is actually an in-between car, much like how the toyota is in between the toyota and the toyota. in japan, to compete with toyota, they actually sell four main levels. toyota would be toyota/toyota/toyota/toyota. honda is honda/honda/honda(u.s. honda)/honda(u.s. acura) all ""honda"" on the badge.

all not premium car in japan or europe, either. it's such a scummy tactic to offer us fewer dumbed-down car and then charge us a significant up-charge for an acura badge.

"" we test drive car and seek out new restaurants as damn near professions as any hobbies could ever be -- so when it came time to drop the acura and infiniti, we seriously went into test driving as the weekend event for a few months. 

here is what we noticed: audi, bmw, porsche and (to a lesser extent) mercedes-benz benz owners participate in ""clubs,"" attend driving schools, take road trips en masse, make trips to germany to visit the holy land (the factories where their car are made) and spend a fair amount of their disposable incomes on logo'd shirts, coats, key-fobs, ball caps, wrist watches, wine glasses, beer mugs and other branded memorabillia. acura, infiniti and lexus owners? not so much.

so, maybe my wife was onto something -- data points suggest the above mentioned germans attract buyers and have owners who are passionate (they have soul perhaps?) about their favorite car brands. other than some key fobs and a narrow selection of ball caps, only the local infiniti dealer even had a branded boutique of items touting their owners love of their brand's car.

 the bmw store, in cincinnati, offers free car washes -- so what you say? well, arrive at the bmw store bright and early on a saturday morning and you will see a line of bmw's, perhaps 20 car deep, waiting to be hand washed -- sometimes the wait is hours. the customers park their car, take a claim ticket from the attendant and gladly walk up to the service center's lounge where there is free starbuck's coffee, all kinds of beverages and snacks and even portable dvd players and headphones with a choice of movies. often the folks chat about their adventures in their x5's or the pleasure they had picking up their car in spartanburg and driving back to cincinnait. some folks regale others about their european delivery pick up in munich and the fun they had driving on the autobahn.

sitting in the acura waiting area didn't even come close -- and there was no waiting room at the infiniti dealer.

somehow, the germans seemed to have cracked the marketing code to imbue their car, dealerships and, most importantly, their customers with passion -- soul -- for their fantastic creations.

fwiw, the winter tires paid for themselves, and then some. consider the following:
 - i had the 530i for three winters before i turned it in at lease end.
 - the winter wheel/tire set cost me $1,005.
 - at lease end my factory tires all had at least 1mm more tread depth than bmw finance's minimum, and as such i didn't need to buy a new set of summer performance tires; cost (then): ~$900 installed.
 - after the bmw was gone i sold the winter wheel/tire set for $500.

long story short, not only did i not pay a fifteen hundred to twenty-five hundred dollar up charge for awd, i made $395 by spending the $1,005 on the winter wheel/tire set. kinda like found money."
,,"basically i meant that any late model rwd car (i.e. equipped with traction control) that isn't shod with summer rubber should be more than capable of handling chicagoland roads in winter weather. the fact is that chicago and its surrounding areas are faaa-lat, and don't need the extra traction afforded by awd or even winter tires for that matter. that said, if i was to move back to chicago and have a rwd car, i'd most certainly buy a set of winter rubber for it.

,,"yeah tl sales are around 40% of the peak sales years ago- this beak issue was never addressed the way they quickly fixed the honda- shame car was very attractive to the segment. unfortunately now it's only attractive because of massive discounts- the looks are just to over the top ugly. i remember in 08, 09 and 10 when i got banned from an acura tl forum because i was questioning it. my point was acrua had lost it's way- graphguy and nycitycarguy and smarty666 all over me for saying the current tl has been a disaster, and that both buick and hyundai were making huge strides catching acura. thanks nyc for reinforcing my point 4 years later, i also like the fact that both nyc and graph now troll german,'smarty is mia, i'm still banded but no one looks at that board anymore."
,,"so split out compact entry level and mid-size entry level. still within the el family, but recognizes different size, mission and competitiors.

acura/audi/cla/bmw 1 class (when it arrives) would be compacts. heck, could maybe slot in a top line volkswagen! oh wait, that is an audi... the ats goes here too.

the ""mid size"" (probably a bad term) are the audi, 3 series (320/328), volvo, tlx, infiniti, mb c class, etc. 

to further mess with your head, i don't count the hipo models as entry level. call them hp compact/mid-size entry level. that would be the s3/s4, bmw, etc. 

seems logical to me. and i don't see a problem having a couple of groupings in the entry level category. the all fit the basic criteria: a premium model, with sporting pretenses and reasonable performance to back it up, and a decent level of luxury features. basically a step up from your basic family sedan or small car. 

and yes, just like with compact to midsize family sedan, there is cross-over in content, performance and price. you can load up an audi to be fancier and more expensive than an audi, and absolutely people can cross-shop them. same with acura to tlx,. still within the ellps family.

i put the cts. e class, 5 series, etc. in the next class up. i think you called them lps (sans el) which seems quite reasonable.

2017 mb e300 test drive
not too sure what happened, but here is the link from the current test drive of the online c&d.

caranddriver.com/reviews/2017-mercedes-benz benz-e300-4matic-test-review?mag=cdb&list=nl_dvr_news&src=nl&date=082616"
,,"thank you everyone for your advice. this weekend i continue the saga to find my next car and here's the report.

mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz c300 4matic
- i really like this car. it looks refined outside and elegant inside. the ride is composed though it feels heavy and a tad slow (vs. my tl. the c300 has 248hp + awd vs. my tl 258hp, that maybe why)
infiniti g37x:
- i like the infiniti design but it's dated. not much change even since the g35. and overall, i find the ""g"" styling works much better with the coupe than the sedan. interior is decent, nothing wow but overall good impression. 
- man, this car is fast. 328hr really works here. however, like many have said before, the engine is not refined.
- so my overall impression with the g37s is so so... i think infiniti know it so they throw in an outstanding lease deal right now.

so at this point, i'm kind of leaning toward the c300

then the next morning, i took my tl out for an oil change. while waiting, i saw a cadillac dealer right across the street. i hate cadillac ""art & science"" design language, to the point i think i'd feel embarrassed driving one. but i've been seeing and hearing enough about the new ats that i decided to give it a try. 
cadillac ats 2.0t
- first off, i think the ats looks the best among the current cadillacs (the new cts looks very good too when i saw it at the ny auto show but it's not current yet). it looks sporty and smart. the led arch looks better in real life than on tv. the interior looks pretty nice too with attention to details. some negatives: the dashboard stitching is a good attempt but looks fake. the high gloss center control looks cheap. and the silver buttons line up ""transformer"" style looks kiddy. i thought only ats suffers from this layout (perhaps the designer tried too hard to make it look young) but surprised to find the same button line up and layout in the cts. too bad, without these negatives, the ats cabin could be one of the nicest in its class. 
- the drive: awesome. wow, this is the first time that i feel the ""fun to drive"" that people have been talking about. it feels light and fast, yet composed and firm. the only car to this point that i want to keep on driving during the test drive.
- after the initial excitement, i went home and did some research about the ats, owner's review. it looks like the cue still has a lot of problem and gas mileage is far below what cadillac claimed. it's kind of expected for a car in its 1st year of its 1st gen. 
- so i think the ats is a great car but not a car for now. 

now, the remaining candidates are bmw bmw bmw and mb c300 4matic. then wife said: bmw. so bmw it will be!"

how does the awd car have such an advantage if it is heavier and has a tendency to understeer (although not as much as a fwd car)? i also know there are different types of awd systems out there. bmw's x drive is rwd based, subaru's symmetrical awd (50/50 split with a subaru manual transmission), audi has 2 types of audi (50/50 & the rear biased in their performance models)."

it was a marketing decision by johan de nysschen to bring infiniti more in line with audi (where he came from). a for car, q for suvs vis a vis q for car, qx for suvs. now he is at cadillac and we are getting ct for car and who knows what for suvs.

as i said before, the new honda is a fair comparison the base tl and you make a strong point. some people might like the design better and the price better. but again they are not the same car and when the premium brand can be had a such discount, it becomes a no brainer of a decision."

plus, pricing product higher you have to acknowledge the expected hit in volume. they are claiming the opposite. that's what is not making sense.

you are right again about upselling service not being limited to luxury car. a couple of years ago, the local tv station did an undercover sting and caught the volkswagen dealer charging for additional services that were not only unnecessary, but they didn't actually perform. idiots tried to charge one elderly customer for an air conditioning recharging service on an older car that didn't have a/c."
,,"thanks all. appreciate the good wishes.

how does it drive? i'll compare it to the bmw. well, that really isn't fair, given you can change the driving characteristics with ""driver select"" on the s4. but, i left it in ""dynamic"" mode on the drive back from chicago, which is the most agressive tuning.

steering is lighter than the bmw at low speeds, but tightens up nicely and linearly as the speeds increase. a smidgeon less feel of the road at low speeds (like when parking), spot on feel at speed. given the rear wheel drive bias, and the torque vectoring, there wasn't a speed i was afraid to attack a corner. i'm sure there were limits, but only because of the tires (which have high limits to begin with).

the sales person (who was a huge enthusiast) suggested i test the ""launch mode""....essentially, turning off trac control, rev the engine while foot is firmly on the brake, then release the brake. all 4 wheels hook up and wow, i was literally launched, like a sling shot. again, didn't have a stop watch. but, i would imagine if you're into stop light wars, unless you're staring at a 'vette, or a high buck exotic along side of you, you won't lose many of those.

flinging into a corner, the s-tronic shifts down with a blip to rev match and then powers out the other end as you exit. impressive.

as mentioned, it's more comfortable than my bmw, and has more room. interior is gorgeous. materials and build are all very high quality (even compared to my bmw, which isn't a slouch in that dept, at all).

on a side note about tires, while we didn't buy the car we test drove, there was a difference between it, and the one we bought.......the tires. the test car had all season sports tires (y rated). the one we eventually bought, had summer only tires. the gf, after driving both car, decided she wanted the all seasons.

the dealer agreed on the swap at no charge. apparently, the all-seasons were a special order on a car in which the sale fell through. so, they were using it as a demo. but, it only had about 100 miles on it. i'm sure if you would track the car, you could tell the difference between the summer tires and the all-seasons. but, i couldn't.

i mentioned previously, i got between 28-29 mpg on my bmw on all highway driving. there wasn't much in the way of break-in recommendations for the s4 in the manual (don't redline it or slam on the brakes in the first 500 miles). we cruised home to sw oh on a tankful, getting 26 mpg in the s4, on a green motor, driving anywhere from 70-80 mph the entire way. that included some in-town, stop and go in the honda, too. i'm thinking the s4 should match the bmw once the engine loosens up a bit.

hey,my last car was a chrysler chrysler, really enjoyed it. some initial quality issues taken care of under warranty. no issues outside the warranty period, but still being a chrysler i wasn't going to keep it too long out of warranty... also, build quality was certainly less than spectacular. but, still enjoyed that car! and, i'm considering a (used) caddy xlr as a toy. but, the interior far from reflects the price and, well, it's a gm... :p 

my current ride, assembled here in los estados unidos, is certainly screwed together to much higher tolerances than the chrysler. no issues, other than a couple of rattles, at 33k+ miles.

,,"aluminum does not repel heat.
the fact is that aluminum is a fantastic conductor of heat.

what this means is that if aluminum is placed near a heat source, it heats very quickly and holds its heat.
once the heat source is removed, it cools quickly as well.

the reason you can hold the aluminum edges from the oven is because, as you open the oven door, the heat source is removed (hot air leaving oven) and replaced with cooler air.
you can then hold the edges because the aluminum has cooled in that area.
if aluminum repelled heat, aluminum oven bags would not work.

aluminum trim in a car can and will become very warm to the touch if the source of heat is constant, like a very hot interior, caused by the sun.
once the interior cools, the aluminum should cool as well, as long as the material behind the trim has cooled as well."

acura is the same, the have a limited selection of color combo's, if you want a acura with a blue exterior, then you will have to settle for black or grey interior. 

didn't we just talk about not having to settle when buying a car?
honda and acura are at least honest about it: some things simply don't even exist in their catalogs. i can deal with that - if it's not there, it's not there. the problem is, others (toyota, ford, mazda) have myriad of combinations ""available"", but units on dealers' lots are ""what sells"" (understandable) and salespeople are not very receptive to order talk (not understandable). bmw and mercedes-benz benz will usually gladly take an order. it seems volkswagen dealers stay more on the ""popular brand"" side, i.e. it's as roadburner said, ""cold ford"" difficult. 

my other problem is, if not a single lot unit has certain type of option (like suspension) that is essential to the way the vehicle feels, how in the world can know whether or not i want it?"
,,"my tl has 245 x 40 x 19""'s which seem adequate -- or, better said, would be adequate if the tires were at least uhp's.

i assume acura chose the rs-a's for two reasons:

#1 they got a deal from goodyear, and
#2 customers didn't care for the summer only rubber that acura had chosen previously.

too many folks here and on all the other ""purpose"" sites [non-permissible content removed] and moan about the dearth (and death) of manual transmissions. yet manufacturers, like acura, in this case, offer them up and 1-3% of their customers acutally buy them. if i were the manufacturer, i would seriously consider dropping something that unpopular unless there was virtually no cost to keep them at least in the brochure (since very few dealers will ever stock one of them.)

likewise, other good deeds don't go unpunished -- my 2009 audi audi with the 19"" sport package came with max performance dunlops -- summer only tires. my dealer claims they never stocked the audi with that sport package because the customers kept the summer tires on year 'round and had drivability issues or tire damage issues, etc. so, no mo' uph or higher rated tires, typically -- because of customer disatisfaction. and, for the most part it is hard to find a car in this price range that doesn't come with a/s shoes.

the list of other options or combination of options that manufacturers try to bring to the buying public that no one buys keeps on comin' -- so to combat this, the manufacturers bundle as much content as they can (or as they dare) into base, plus and max packages and pretty much disallow a la carte selection.

those that do allow you to add individual options often require that you first hyundai up for plus or max packages before they let you add your individual choices of extras. case in point, to get the 19"" wheel/tire sport package on an audi audi, i first had to agree to buy the audi configured as a prestige model. no 19"" wheels for the proletariat.

acura pissed me off -- a bit -- by not allowing me to select the blind spot warning system unless i went with the advance designation; now that i have the advance, i am glad, since i also got the 19"" wheels (albeit with crappy tires) and ventilated (heated and cooled) seat along with the bsw system.

of course every manufacturer here in ellps land seems to want you to buy off the lot, rather than order the car and wait for it to be made exactly to your specifications. hence, we get essentially only two or three ""package"" choices.

i'd like to see more than one tire choice offered to those willing to wait for their car to be built; i'd also like to have a greater choice of interior and exterior color choices. why is it that i couldn't get pearl white paint and the umber leather interior, but i could get crystal black with umber? who's dumbass rule is that anyway?

the list of incomprehensible rules regarding how we can configure a $45,000+ car never ceases to honda. i guess there would have to be some rules -- especially since most of these car are leased (the residual value of a purple car with a white leather interior would be, after all, low, lower, lowest) -- but if the customer is willing to pay for something (not a one off, mind you) that you are already offering -- just not in that combination -- take the customer's money for pity's sake!

why are back-up sensors not a factory option on an acura tl? my dealer broke the rear bumper (which is, essentially, plastic) trying to install them (since the bumber has to be drilled), then after the bumper was repaired, the bumper had to be specially repainted since i had to be so lucky as to have pearl-effect paint (137 coats or some such thing).

the dealer didn't make any money on that transaction -- and even they wonder why such a popular option on this class of car is not standard equipment (within the technology or advance packages) or at least a factory installed option.

where was i? what time is it? oh yeah -- who in the wide, wide world of sports decided to put rs-a's on the top o' the line tl?

,,"on the s4 i think the lower rear end of the back bumper should be painted body color, but it isn't. works better with some colors moreso than others.

on the tl the roof seams should really not be big black bars, but either seamless or at least body colored.

if my $30k out the door audi can have seamless roof, why can't tl?

acura misses:  els sounds system should be standard in all sh-awd tl models, as should the better perforated milano leather. tech package should have neither of those features inside it, but it does. 

audi misses: sport diff should be standard, metallic paint should be standard, and price should be a tad lower."

that said, i do think the tl sh awd, while not as fast in a straight line vs the s4 or bmw (but certainly more than capable), feels more balanced, confidence inspiring and entertaining in its own right. then, there's the elephant in the room....the significant price difference
i'm pretty excited to get behind the wheel of the tlx."
,,"i meant to say, ""stuff"" is not everything. it is possible to sell ""more car"" with less ""stuff"". lotus would be an example. my point bmw has always been more expensive in relation to acura, lexus, or audi. they have always got away with it. will they in the future? only time will tell."

with a (then) wife, and a kid, the chevrolet ""jones"" went away. once the wife was gone, and the kid grew up, my tastes changed (to luxury sports sedan). i don't fall in love with my car like others do. i know some chevrolet aficionados who are die hard. i know many more who got their fix, and like you, let it go.

i feel fortunate that i'm able to own some awfully fine car...bmw, audis, acuras, go fast mustangs, etc. had one cadillac. will never own another (a story for another time).

fn...once the hype machine finishes on the ats, we'll see how it shakes out. you're right, the cts just started to be competitive with its last iteration. even there, the competition has passed it by.

the ats may be a competitor to the bmw, or audi. but, how long will that last?

the trade rags do a little track testing. run around with a car for a few days, maybe a week. the most they drive a car is their ""long term"" fleet. even there, that's only for a year, on average. and, not one person drives it for a long period of time.

so, renting a car is a good way for someone to get a feel for it. i know i've been able to rent a mercedes-benz benz, a caddy, a volvo (surprisingly good), and some others. i actually was able to get a lengthy test drive (longer than a day) on a bmw, audi s4 and a cadillac cts coupe (which gave me the opportunity to cross it off my list). you come to some very realistic conclusions that the trade rags don't pay much attention to driving and using them as you would on a daily basis."

the ""take rate"" of 5% for the tl means that 5% of all tl's in 2010 were manual transmissions. the 1 in 6305 odds of being sold means that of all car sold in the us in 2010, 1 in 6,305 was a manual tl.

test: the ""take rate"" on the toyota was 3%, but the odds were 1 in 1237. which if you do the math backwards, implies that there were about 8.5 times as many toyota's sold in the us than tl's. according to the site listed below, total tl sales were 34,039 in 2010 and total toyota sales were 327,804. that's 9.5 times as many, but given motor trend rounded the ""take rate"" to the nearest percent, is within the rounding error. 

sales by model

looking at it another way, total car sales in the us were 11,371,674 in 2010. odds of one of those car being a manual tl, 1 in 6305 = 1,804 total. odds of one of those being a manual toyota, 1 in 1,237 = 9,193 total. odds of one of those being a manual cayenne, 1 in 37,361 = 304 total.

acura 4cyl automatic - 22 honda / 31 highway
acura 6cyl automatic - 18 honda / 28 highway

driving my 4cyl & the dealer's 6cyl back to back gave me a good perspective on the strengths & weaknesses of each.

steering - one thing i truly dislike about my 2010 acura 4 cyl is the lifeless electric power steering. it transmits no road feel at low speeds and artificially firms up at higher speeds.

the 6 cyl is equipped with hydraulic power steering. while a little over boosted for my tastes, it is progressively linear and very smooth. i totally prefer this setup to the electric unit in my 4 cyl.

the v6 has an obvious edge in the acceleration department. jump on the accelerator and it keeps going. i was traveling at triple digit speeds this am berore i backed off and returned to a much more sedate 70. passing is never a problem. 

my 4 cyl's acceleration is adequate. it never feels strained. i also know how to use the engine's high rpm power band. merging onto the highway and cruising at 80 - 90 mph aren't a problem. i have to admit that getting back into my car tonight i was disappointed after driving it's v6 cousin for a day.

both car ride nicely without feeling isolated. 

the handling edge goes to my 4 cyl acura hands down. while far from a dedicated rwd chassis, the acura makes the most of its honda platform roots. there is a lightness to it. you can feel the weight transfer going around curves.

the v6 is 200 lbs heavier & you feel the boat anchor during spirited driving. the vsa (skid control) is constantly fighting with this giant weight over the front wheels.

the acura is definitely (imo) a luxury, performance oriented vehicle. having driven both the e90 bmw 3 series (in both 328 & 335 flavors) as well as the infiniti g37x, i think there's no argument from anybody they are the true driver's car of the group.

i've read up and am impressed by the new mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz reviews, but will reserve judgement until i actually get behind the wheel of one.

i think even though it is fwd, the acura stacks up against an audi audi 2.0t (not the $50,000 prestige with audi's sport differential).

i've told you guys before, i originally bought the acura for my wife using a cash for clunkers credit. i inherited it from her when we decided to buy a honda in anticipation of our 3rd child (whitney is 3 weeks old today). 

would i have bought it for myself if i went out car shopping for my daily driver that didn't have fuel economy restrictions? it wouldn't have been my 1st choice, i'll readily admit.

driving dynamic wise, i'd pick the e90 3 then the g37xs sedan, & a distant 3rd would be the acura.

i'm happy with my acura."

,,"https://loupventures.com/tesla-model-3-cost-of-ownership-slightly-cheaper-than-a-toyota/

""average all-in cost per mile for a model 3 is $0.46, compared to the toyota le at $0.49, and audi audi at $0.80.""

this study claims to show that a tesla model 3 costs less over 5 years than a toyota toyota, which is shocking.

but i don't agree with some of the numbers that were used. for instance, it says that maintenance and repairs for a toyota over 5 years will be about $4000, but my guess is that it would be about half of that (10 oil changes x $50 each =$500 + 4 tires for c.$1000 + 500 additional would be my estimate). the tesla model was c. $39k on which no discounts are possible, but with a toyota for c.$25k you might get $4000 off of msrp, which they didn't indicate. so i feel like the study is about $6000 off in favor of the tesla. finally, although the tesla battery has a 8 years/100,000 mile warranty, i'm wondering if you own the tesla for 10 years and 150,000 or more miles if a new $8000 or so battery is likely to be needed.

still, the bottom line is that the economics may possibly be shifting toward electrics, and specifically tesla. there's no doubt that a tesla is cheaper over 5 years than their other comparison, which was an audi audi. and now elon musk says that starting next year the design life of the battery for the model 3 will more than double:

https://electrek.co/2019/04/23/tesla-battery-million-miles-elon-musk/

if this pans out, this means that in a year or two the batteries of a teslas model 3 will be able to last maybe as much as 500,000 miles. the electric motors for a tesla are already likely to last at least 500,000 miles, because well-designed electric motors are inherently longer lasting than most internal combustion engines. 

plus there are no oil changes etc. for high-mileage drivers the tesla might become a top choice, because the cost per mile driven would almost certainly be quite low.

i've gone from being a tesla skeptic to someone who thinks there might be something to this."

not long after, hagerty was bugging me for some feedback. i wrote on the form how i didn't like their restrictive policies. a rep called me after that to talk about it. he said they will cover for pleasure use and not just ""to and from car shows."" which is good because i still have my mr2 covered by them. 

so, anyway, there are options out there for you.

good luck with this one. anxious to hear a good outcome."

i find audi, bmw and kia at top almost shocking. especially audi. interestingly enough, volkswagen is way to the bottom, so it seems even though they share some parts, the overall qc must be much better there. also, porsche being closer to volkswagen than to audi is interesting. 

i will believe chrysler's improvement (it jumped over other domestics) if it remains there for a few years. and where is fiat? off the scale?
audi's been providing the icing with the cake since the mid 2000's. where have you been? 
pretty darn consistent at the top right behind lexus for luxury makes the last 5 years or so. still, not at lexus reliability levels yet (or ever). 

i think we all saw cadillac tumbling coming based on @graphicguy experiences. unlike some that write-off personal experiences reported here as anecdotal, i take it to likely be ""par"" for the course as that is statistically most likely to happen. bmw's improvement is both significant and recent. they weren't that hot in prior years. 

kia has been inching toward the top for awhile now too. one of the reasons i got one, as they surpassed honda and acura for a few years now. audi's qc is most definitely superior to volkswagen's. has been for a long time, and most audi's are still made in europe while volkswagen's in mexico. 

as to chrysler's improvement, they had no where to go but up."

the good news is, you can buy a infiniti cheap right now. just helped my sister buy a tl sh awd (still one of my all time favorites). good deals on those, too.

it's hard to beat the smoothness and the sounds the 6 cyl engines in the bmw, acuras, audis, mercedes-benz benz, lexus. bmw should take some lessons from audi with regards to how to build a smooth, torquey 4 cyl turbo.

kind of wanting to drive the lexus es after seeing that article. closest i ever came to owning a lexus was a few years ago, when the is350 first hit the streets. only reason i didn't was the dealership(s) didn't like that i wanted to make a skinny deal on one. today, they would jump all over such a deal, from what i hear. but, i'm no longer interested."

so renting a car while on a business trip for a couple of days is a better test than the above? how much track testing is done on a business rental? a couple days rental is better because it's ""real world"" compared to several weeks of driving by several different professional reviewers during a year long test? one person is working at a regular job, the other is doing nothing but evaluating a car. i guess reading any reviews by any kind of magazine or blog is a waste time. we should just wait for somebody on here to rent one for a couple days and give a thumbs up or thumbs down? 

i like how some people put down the ats right off the bat by reading about the 0-60 estimates from cadillac(not professional testing or rental car) and reading that it has an inch or so less back seat space than a 3(now that's what i base my decisions on, lol). then turn around and ask someone else if they have any real world time in a vehicle as if they can't comment on it unless they have. kind of hypocritical if you ask me."

,,"the new car are ""better"" in some ways, but they are simply not as good on mountain roads and zipping in and out of traffic. they weigh too much and their wheelbase is too long. they are simply not anything like the original sport sedan which bmw and volvo made in the early 70s that created the whole segment.

it has gotten so bad that bmw was essentially forced to make the 1 series to remain competitive. the 1 series is at least pretty close to the e36, which is barely passable. a bit heavy, but workable with some weight reduction tricks and some aftermarket tweaks. i put the specs for the older e30, though, because it's really the benchmark for this class. which every manufacturer seems to have simply ignored in the race to have more and more power. (same as the ""big 3"" did in the 70s with muscle car).

heavier than a buick. that's just sad and as long as bmw keeps making car that are heavier than rental-fodder buick, well, my comments about them being muscle car stands."

,,"i discovered an error in my research. i'm not sure what i did, but the above described c350 actually costs $48,190, not $46,440. (edit: the $1750 leather seat didn't get added in)

i also just noticed that when i added the wood trim to the infiniti, it automatically added the $1200 technology package, which includes rain-sensing wipers and pre-crash seatbelts. since these are standard features on the c350, this doesn't change the math in my previous post.

the increase in the price of the c350 raises the gap between the merc and infiniti up to about $3150.

however, something else occurred to me... 

take the well equipped c350 described above and remove the metallic paint ($720), 18"" wheels ($1040), and leather interior ($1750) - options which affect appearance only (barely, if at all) and have no effect on performance, toyota, safety, or functionality.

the same c350 now costs $44,680 - a savings of $3500!

now do the same thing with the above described infiniti and remove the wood trim...oh wait, the technology package requires the wood trim. ok, lets remove the 18"" wheels...nope, they're part of the sport package that includes the upgraded suspension. leather seat are standard, so that's not an option. ok, i hate to lose it, but what about the moonroof? sorry, it's part of the premium package which includes driver memory settings and bose premium audio.

,,"so, for rick, the hyundai came in first place when he overlayed his price vs attribute ( ie value) priorities

good point and is exactly what i was saying previously. the bmw may be #1 in a couple of categories which is most important to some ellps buyers. to many other ellps buyers the value equation may be more important. long term reliability and repair frequency and cost are very important to me as i buy car for cash and keep them for at least 6 years, some longer. i want a peppy, luxurious, smaller car that i don't have to have repaired frequently once the warranty is gone(or before for that matter) and i like a nice handling car but i don't need one that i can zip around the cloverleafs at 70mph....50 is fine thank you. 

so bmw can be #1 for some people but for many it is much farther down the list for a number of valid reasons. nobody is arguing that it is not #1 in cutting corners. so to say a certain car is ""loser"" or always #2 is ridiculous as it is #1 to the thousands that buy it. and to also say that those same people cannot afford another few thousand dollars more is elitist to say the least and condescending at best."

trouble spots
consumer guide's® auto editors have scoured repair bulletins and questioned mechanics to search for commonly occurring problem for a particular vehicle. in some cases we also give possible manufacturer-suggested solutions. in many instances these trouble spots are technical service bulletins posted by the manufacturer, however, we have our own expert looking at additional vehicle problem.
automatic transmission: the transmission may quit working due to fluid loss caused by the output flange nut coming loose. (2003-04)
battery: the battery may go dead overnight if the brightness lever for the panel lights is set to bright and inadvertently goes far enough to power up the dash integration module, but not far enough to turn on the courtesy lights inside the car. (2003-04)
electrical problem: the fuel gauge will read empty after filling up if the engine is left running. trouble codes may also be set which will have to be cleared by the dealer. (2003)
engine noise: the brackets attached to the catalytic converter may crack or break resulting in a rattle or buzzing noise that seems to come from the engine compartment. (2003-04)
steering problem: -service steering system+ warning light comes on because of failure of the variable effort steering solenoid. (2003)
water leak: passenger side carpet gets wet in winter due to ice forming in the hvac plenum drain hose unless it is modified. (2003)
consumer guide® estimated repair costs
this table lists costs of likely repairs for comparison with other vehicles. the dollar amount includes the cost of the part(s) and labor (based on $50 per hour) for the typical repair without extras or add-ons. like the pricing information, replacement costs can vary widely depending on region. expect charges at a new-car dealership to be slightly higher.
item name repair cost
a/c compressor $750
alternator $460
automatic transmission or transaxle $3,550
clutch, pressure plate, bearing $0
constant velocity joints $1,550
exhaust system $565
radiator $780
shocks and/or struts $2,710
timing chain or belt $750
nhtsa recall history
2004: driver+s frontal airbag and/or roof-mounted side-impact airbag in some car could deploy when ignition key is turned to -on+ position.
2004: washers for ball stud assemblies on lower control arm of some car could fracture; separation of control arm from its knuckle will cause a corner of the vehicle to drop, and control arm may contact the wheel, resulting in dragging action and unwanted tendency to turn.

if the tbn is over 1.5 and wear metals(aluminum, copper, iron, lead) are tracking within about 25% of universal averages(adjusted for mileage) i would think that your oil is probably being changed too early. aside from the break in period and the variable valve timing actuator tsb the uoas from my ms3 have been remarkably consistent- even when the car has seen the track.

we're here -- well some of us are -- in ellps land perhaps because we ""choose"" not to buy/lease an lps automobile. perhaps some of us -- as alfred sloan imagined -- would start with a chevrolet and aspire to a pontiac, oldsmobile, buick and ultimately a cadillac. i suspect sloan is the father of the term ""aspirational"" as it applied to car.
we're here, i'll bet, because we either aspire to an ellps, have an ellps and aspire to an lps or are just car-nuts who know the good stuff comes from audi, bmw, infiniti, etc.
i was wondering today when the last time i saw a phaeton was -- years ago is all i could come up with. saw several audi's today, however. i test drove a phaeton (way back when) which was seriously discounted and sub-vented (and as a reminder i owned an audi) thinking i could get a ""new audi"" for a fraction of the cost by going with the phaeton. the phaeton was, closed eyes, an audi. same sweeeet 4.2l v8, audi (well, you know) etc. i just couldn't bring myself to pull the trigger -- probably the biggest bargain i'll ever see. damn huge-[non-permissible content removed] ""volkswagen"" emblem on the thing.
instead of the bargain it probably was, i knew i would be thinking, ""i paid this much for a volkswagen?!? what was i thinking?""
you know i still think if you can't or won't go with an s4, the next best thing is the acura tl sh-awd advance (and i assume the tlx is even better). even my non-car loving friends called my tl ""a honda."" slamming the tinny doors was just enough of a confirmation of that notion to remind me that the acura brand had slipped from premium status.
my wife collects pens -- i have perhaps four or five (that were gifts from her) -- i probably would not go out and buy a new 4-figure montblanc, but i do notice when i see brian williams use one on the air. my montblancs (3 of them) are all the pens i need (one of them broke and i had to send it to germany to get it fixed -- seems as good as new). my wife must get 6 new pens per year. i sort of get it. until her current car (the sq5 prestige), she liked car, but wasn't really ""passionate"" about them.
get this, for about 15 minutes she actually considered a subaru -- which was pretty nice, but kind of trucky and not at all luxurious or even terribly sporty. i knew she would love the price and by the time she needed her second tank of gas would be ""praying for the end of time"" (meat loaf).
now, however, she is ""into car"" and is unlikely to aspire to anything other than an audi or a bmw -- i can't see reverse aspiration being a viable option (for her or for most people, in fact).
anyway, this collection of ellps car is perhaps the most exciting and ""strokable"" lot in all of cardom. it is here that we see innovation (often before the lps offerings, even from the same brand), performance and often a huge leap up from even the top of the next lower line.

well the epa is fueleconomy.gov so it is a reliable source. here is the link:

the epa measure cubic footage of the seating areas. based on that criteria, the rapide is a subcompact. aston designed the rapide with 4 tight seat with a huge console running through the middle of the car. don't blame the epa for aston's poor space utilization.

,,"i don't want to start an argument, although i am not against arguing, if that makes any sense. but i was struck by the statements that things are becoming obsolete (perhaps the implication was ""on purpose"") every 30 months or so.

let me provide some perspective that made me read the ""30 months"" statement and cock my head and have a cartoon balloon with a question mark in it appear overhead.

i have a 2014 audi s4 premium plus with mmi+ and the b&o sound system. i also have the silk nappa leather seat upgrade. 

previously i had a 2009 audi audi prestige and sport package equipped 2.0t audi (it also had the power rear sunshade and ads and the b&o sound system.)

before that i had a 2005 audi audi 3.2 with sport wheels and nav and sport seat (with the $1,000 premium leather option), the bose sound system and the built in phone cradle and whatever else made a 2005 audi cost nearly $54,000 new.

now, i kept my 2005 audi about 42 months (6 months beyond the end of the lease due to the delayed delivery in 2008 of the 2009 audi's). i kept the 2009 full term and put some 56k miles on it (and 66k miles as i recall on the '05 audi.)

one month ago i get into my new 2014 s4 configured as noted above.

if you would have put me into my new 2005 audi and i had become familiar with the controls and the layout of everything and the functioning and format of the electronics and then you had me close my eyes for ""a second"" and re-opened them in october 2008 whilst i was seated behind the wheel of my 2009 audi, then repeated the process and i opened my eyes behind the wheel of my 2014 s4, i would have almost thought all that had changed was the color of the seat and dashboards. 

my audi had a black dash with the baseball glove colored leather seat -- the wood trim was walnut dark brown; my audi had an ecru dash and seat -- the wood trim was oak blonde; next up, the s4 has a black dash with the magma red leather seat and carbon fiber trim.

the electronics (the automotive ""avionics"") were virtually unchanged from calendar year 2004 through 2013 (10 years, 120 months). yes, there are some incremental (and mostly pretty small) ""improvements"" in the avionics. i can now recite an entire 10-digit phone number and the voice recognition system doesn't respond ""pardon?"" the moving map is said to be 3d, but that's not literally true, although there is a greater perception of ""depth"" as one looks at the map (sitting or moving).

the b&o system in the 2014 my s4 may be a little bit better than the excellent version of the system circa 2008 in the my 2009 audi (and the b&o is better than the bose that was in the '05 audi.) 

overall, though, i would say there has been no ""built-in obsolescence"" since this car's ""systems"" have been around for 10 years without anything of any real form and/or function changing.

now, however, therefore, notwithstanding -- i like the b8's electronics/avionics -- just as i did when i first met them in the '05 audi. i continued to enjoy them in the 2009 audi and although i do -- from time to time -- touch the screen on the s4 thinking it has [or that it must have] the same capabilities that most of today's smart-phones and tablet pc's have. 

some are already saying (and have been saying so for some time now) that audi's interior (from the driver's perspective) is long in the tooth. and, maybe, just maybe keeping the look and feel and user interface pretty much the same for 10 years is too long, i think the 2014 audi interior and electronics package has taken a step back, looking like the second gen cadillac cts, which i didn't care for. 

i keep my nav screen on almost all of the time. i would hate to have one of those aftermarket looking things (for instance, the pop-up nav that came on gen 2 cts and the current iteration of audi's) that somehow passes for forward movement. who's dumb idea was it to spoil the flowing lines of the newest audi interior with that silly screen that looks, to my eye, as if it were an afterthought.

,,"if she only drives about 1000 miles a month, the older ctss(2007 models) are currently going for $2000 down and $299 a month.(no security/etc). 

it's a very nice deal and not a bad car, really, if you get it with manual. now, sure, people deride the interior, but as opposed to what - payments/buying a new chevrolet or toyota for $299 a month? put in this light, it's a fine car and costs the exact same as buying it and then selling it yourself, which is rare in a lease. 

essentially you save massive taxes and a couple of hundred per month for the same cost to drive in the end. a win-win situation. and, given the cts's projected resale once the new models are out, you can probably re-buy the car from the dealer's used car lot after trading it in for 2-3k less than the ""buyout"" cost.(evil grin)

,,"qbrozen said:couldn't agree more. no idea why they just don't lower their prices. i mean, rather than try to get 10k people to pay $2k under and 25k people to pay $10k under, just lower them $5k and kill the rebates and advertise the hell out of the fact that you trump the others in comparison tests and undercut their prices. you lose $270k with the first scenario but have nothing to crow about vs $175k in scenario 2 with a great selling point.
simple - there is always a hope for a sucker who will pay more. moreover, there is also fear that lowering the price won't help - people will still ask for further discount. not to mention 5k is probably more than their profit margin on first production year, perhaps even longer. last - they still think ""it's a cadillac"" means, the sticker has to be high, cause you know, it meant that 30 years ago."

i'm familiar with lindsay, too. while, i've not visited the store, i had dealt with one of the sales people there, who wasn't very good. i was looking for a particular color combo. he said he had it. when i asked him for the vin#, he strung me along, wanting me to come to the store to ""talk about the car"". i wanted to make sure they had the color combo before making a 90 minute drive. i told him all it would take for me to drive up to visit him was the vin so i could confirm he had what i wanted. he couldn't/wouldn't he wouldn't assure me of that.

kyfdx.....here's the blurb on edmunds (which my dealer confirms they can do).....

http://www.insideline.com/bmw/1-series/bmw-offers-performance-power-kit-for-135i- -and-bmw.html

i know the previous 135/335 had the twin turbo (n54), and the new ones have the twin scroll turbo (n55). i've driven both. the n54 had a bit of turbo lag (not much). but, bmw overboosts it at higher rpm (which is why the 335is is rated with more hp and torque than the n55. however, i think both motors are under rated and put out more hp and torque than bmw says they do.

that said, i'm trying to decide if i want the extra hp/torque. that would essentially make my bmw coupe with the same engine performance as the 335is, which is mighty good.

but, mine is really good to begin with. i'm debating but probably will do it when i can schedule some time at the dealership to get it done. who doesn't like more hp and torque? :shades:

,,"mark, consider that blueguy lives in san diego - pretty tough to justify an awd sedan down there.

i happen to agree with both of you in that, awd is a value adder in many markets that see inclement weather, or in the case of audi, it does mitigate some of the negative fwd handling characteristics on their heavier, softer car. on the other hand, i haven't driven an audi with sport package, but i suspect it's pretty tight and light on it's feet, and i could see the added weight and driveline friction of awd being a negative there.

finally, i wouldn't say that anyone shopping/owning a car in this segment is a ""purist."" these car, by their very nature, are unpure thanks to their luxury, soundproofing, weight, and power-assisted everything. a purist would drive an mazda or evo ix before choosing one of these leviathans. 

i think some people want to try to stay on the ""purer"" end of the scale and would prefer a fwd audi 2.0t to an awd audi 3.2 audi - others feel the opposite but both are valid. if i still lived in southern california, i don't think i could justify buying a 3660# audi audi when there's another, identical looking audi on the lot that is 400 lbs lighter, is more fun to drive, and costs thousands less.

there is a huge market for awd sedan out there, but they still aren't for all people and all markets."

well i last posted on may 29. whew! i think i am finally caught back up on the reading of the many -- mostly very good -- posts.

talking with specificity about car you haven't driven is like critiquing a movie after only seeing the trailers -- that's a good one, i will be swiping that with great enthusiasm and some frequency.
going on and on about how a 5, 10, 15 year old or older car and proclaiming it is better than the current crop must've been said/written sarcastically or perhaps ironically. not that everything new is better, but, well as a general rule things (like car) have tended to be better along with the passage of time.
stick shifts are great, ""no one"" buys them anymore because: see #2. oh, somewhere i read that even in car -- like the ellps's -- that actually do offer stick shifts, the take-up by actual paying customers continues to shrink and it is something less than 3% or perhaps 2%. now that i have, in my garage, a 7-speed dual-clutch and an 8-speed tiptronic, i know the reason. if the best of breed 8-speed doesn't ""shift your opinion"" well today's 7-speed dual-clutch certainly will be virtually irresistible.
some folks here will correctly note that they can option load-up a non-ellps car, note that it meets or beats the ""fill-in-the-blank"" ellps in content, performance and the big one, price and apparently end with an implied ""so how 'bout them apples"" or ""so there!""
continuing:
in my experience ""people need those stinkin' badges!""
to make a, or perhaps ""the"" point: my montblanc pen uses a 3 or 4-dollar refill, the same one used in some other really ""way less expensive"" (i'll say) pens. in the same spirit, my tag watch doesn't tell time any better than my $750 swiss army watch i got at macy's. that's not the point -- well, ok, it may be one point, but it's the overall ""certain something"" that makes luxury goods, well, hmm, ""worth more."" once i get over ""needing"" a white and blue roundel or four interlocking rings, etc, well, i'll get a kia of some sort.

,,"although i wasn't as active a participant here (and elsewhere) whilst i had my 2012 acura tl sh-awd advance, i was a frequent reader of the postings and musings of those who participated those ""lonely"" 28 months.

i would not hesitate to recommend an acura such as the one i had -- i would, however, try to put things into perspective for someone shopping for one of these ellps vehicles. the acura was ______________ (fill in the blank with some mostly positive comments) and it remains an attractive car considering its price and (at the time) considering the fact that it is/was heavily discounted (13% off sticker in my case). i will still remember it as acura's s4 (despite the fact that few would ever cross-shop the two car).

if you're looking to enter into ellps land ""on the cheap"" i would say you can't do better than go for one of the current tl sh-awd versions (the fwd version, however, does not qualify). however, in response to comments about acura's ""tech/electronics"" working (apparently compared to audi's mmi+), well i know it is a ""nit"" but the voice response software (at least in mine) would not function according to the owner's manual. i called acura and took my car to the dealer (who had an acura tech super user as a sales rep) -- both sources say the voice activation did have ""bugs"" in it. moreover, when i asked acura if there would be a fix, they said ""no updates are in the pipeline at this time."" 

i have (remembering that i have had three different mmi car since 2005) had my ""mmi os"" -- what i would call ""windows for the car"" updated once on the 2005 and once on the 2009 -- and nothing so far on the 2014. i never had and still have never had any issues with my mmi+ equipped audis. and, everything works.

on my acura, for example, the car can have the voice activation system set to a really annoying configuration where the voice system essentially mimics everything you say after you say it and before it does it. it can be turned off (same thing on my wife's 2011 infiniti fx) -- when the voice prompt system is turned to ""minimalist"" mode, it is pretty easy to live with since it doesn't delay and doesn't parrot back your commands as if you might not really have meant what you asked of it. but, when in minimalist mode, functions (voice commands) that the manual says work . . .won't. 

the acura has no clock that is easy to locate at a glance. however, it has a feature that allows you to simply ask, out loud, ""what time is it?"" and, the voice system recites the correct time. i thought it was a fairly neat little command that i often used when i was alone in the car and, well, er -- speeding. i could, without hunting on my wrist or the dash panel simply say ""what time is it?"" the system would comply and tell me the time of day.

however, this feature was ""disabled"" (and acura said it should work regardless of the setting of the voice system to ""annoying"" mode) unless the voice response system was set to ""long mode"" (annoying mode). 

another annoying feature was the phone number input (by voice) which would inevitably put a zero in front of the number i was dialing -- or sometimes it would put a ""#"" sign and announce the character as ""pound.""

overall, the acura system worked fairly well -- but there were more quirks in it than in any of my 3 audis or my wife's tech package fx. over the course of 28 months, i rarely used the voice command capability because it was either a little frustrating or annoying to use. mmi, by comparison is almost like ""natural language"" (almost).

the infiniti system, too, rarely gets it wrong and doesn't require any time at all to learn to use.

the point, belabored for sure, is that i (a voice of one) found the acura system ""more trouble than it was worth"" and also a system that wasn't nearly as intuitive as my wife's bmw (2008) or her 2011 infiniti or any audi i've had with the voice feature.

to each his/her own to be sure -- but i'm all for updating the tech systems on these car asap and with as much frequency as it takes to get the bugs out. :surprise:

i concur....i think the prevalence of all these blown motors hyundai.once you get them rolling. even from a dead stop, they have come to the point where there is no turbo lag because of twin turbos and twin scroll turbos. s/cs are even better.

all of these high technology motors with di, ohc/dohc, turbo/sc, etc have come ot the point where they're all pretty impressive given the power and efficeincy they offer.

on the other end of that spectrum, the old adage ""there's no repacement for displacement"" still rings true....especially in the torque dept. 

i wouldn't mind some seat time in a new ford gt or a dodge scat pack! 


it does indeed. 

but, when a motor with displacement of only 2.0l and offers nearly 300 ft/lb of torque, have to admit, that's impressive. actually, the torque figures are better than those found in the 3.6l v6 motor they also use."

scooters are the way to get around town, and let me tell you they will let you know it too. just a random shot 




yes, they are looking for the next winner of the voice of france here in marseilles




ok so we are americans, we stopped in a mikey d's to get a coke, interesting place, you can order take out or have it served at your table and order at this kiosk, the mccafe is a separate area in miky d's, they had pastries and macaroon's.






so now it's all about the car's we saw, the first if a peugeot wagon, very popular and a looker too.




another peugeot hatchback




here is an audi a2




here is a surprise, this is a kia, called a ceep, very good looking car.





we can park how we want, because we are french..



the mediterranean, and sorry guys no topple women at this beach...



an alfa 147, another popular car in europe



the names car companies give their car, we had a good laugh at this one. 



so the next couple of photos are interesting, we ran into a wedding procession of the well to do, all the license plates were from monaco. 





this amg did not sound stock at all..







now this is what the bride rode in, a limo of a chrysler with a rr front end...




now some random photos of the honda






on our walk back to the hotel we came upon this glass cover, very interesting, this is a photo of my taking a photo straight up, looking down at me.




just the harbor 




so some of the chrysler car are brought over here but sold as lancia, the 300 is called the thema, it's a big car over here..

thanks it for now, off to beaune france."

any thoughts yet................ pro's / cons going from the honda to a tlx. 
huge difference. wish i'd done it before. although it might be that the great deal i got was only available at this time for the significantly improved 2018 tlx. the 2017 tlx iirc lacked acurawatch and lacked androidauto, both essential features imho.

on the tlx 2.4 the 0-60 acceleration, to be blunt, seems about the same as an honda to me—although how you get there is different. at first acceleration seems faster in the tlx in 1st and 2nd, but then as it quickly goes toward 4th, 5th and beyond, it just loses punch. this is all in ""normal"" mode. i think i might try sport for a while and see what that's like. the tlx's 2.4 engine, of course, is a slightly souped up version of the honda's engine that's made to take advantage of premium gas.

but aside from the engine almost everything else is a big upgrade over an honda. for the most part, you can't even tell that there's any relation between the two car. the steering with paws is sharper and better, the transmission with the 8-speed dual clutch is also a very different experience from a cvt, the leather seat feel as comfortable and supportive as those of the new bmw i was just in yesterday, the suspension has that planted feeling almost like you are riding on rails (but it's still really comfortable), etc. and the the sound system is beyond anything honda offers, and maybe even better than what's offered in a comparable bmw or lexus."

,,"billyperks4 said:
""there are a lot of really good car (as good or better than bmw) at price points that are much less""

which???
the problem i have with the statement would entirely go away if the words between the parenthesis had not been part of the declaration.

furthermore, my issue with most of these car -- but the germans top the list of offenders -- rears its head because i typically select the top option package and then add individual options on top of that.

a base (good luck finding one) audi s4 is hard to beat -- but i wouldn't have one unless it had, navigation, b&o sound system, blind spot monitoring . . . and the list goes on. there is no way the technology we (or i) love, voice-activated navigation + bluetooth, etc, is worth $3,500. hell, i can buy a 75"" samsung hdtv for about $500 less than that, and that price is dropping 2% per month.

so, yeah, there are very good car at attractive price points -- we can argue if this or that is better than a bmw or an audi or a mercedes-benz benz, etc, but there are a lot of comparable car if popularly equipped. my car has almost $10,000 worth of options on it, and i didn't even get a prestige model.

the base fill in the blank german fill in the blank is likely to drive, perform and ride better than the ""other guy"" -- but the heck of it is, the german car will be a strippie and the other guy will come chock full of features that just seem out of touch with even a generous gross margin.

now, having said that, i will prove myself a walking and driving contradiction. i do, to this very day, believe that the acura tlx sh-awd with the advance package (and only that configuration) is acura's s4. and, it is really damn near impossible to find one that rings up a $50,000 tab. yet, if you drive the two car, back to back, well there is that certain something (that my wife calls soul) that the acura doesn't even seem to attempt to imitate. but the tlx's numbers are, for the bucks, impressive.

so, i complain about the price of the s4 vs the tlx (which makes a good case for itself as being in the same league), but i still put down the extra $6k-$12k for the audi because i test drove it.

,,"i don't think anyone said that the ""majority"" were over 61 because the average was 61. the general idea is that probably something close to half are 61 years old, and 25% are above that and 25% below that.

robr2 said: mr_shiftright said:well that's good but keep in mind that age 61 is still an *average*. 
well the average age of a bugatti buyer is 60. does that mean that only old codgers buy them?

only knowing the mean does not provide enough information to declare that ""about half"" of the buyers are old codgers. to have a really good understanding of what the majority of ages is, you would also need to know the mode, median and range -- to get a better idea of the number(s) that occurs most often. the issue with mean is that a bunch of 45-ish year olds buying a certain car would return an ""average age"" around 45, as you would expect; but, throw in a couple of purchases by some 25 year olds and a few more over 75 and well, depending on the size of the population, you could skew below or above 45 even though the population as individuals is ""over half"" 45-ish.

i was quite surprised to see the average age of bmw buyers was ""that old!"" but, you see, i've been going to the bmw store here in cincinnati at least since the mid 1980's, and my impression is that the show room is full of shoppers who are ""really really young"" -- and i have always presumed well-to-do. i went the audi route when all my friends went with bmw's because #1 the audi brand had audi and #2, i always felt you could buy the next higher line of audi for the same price as the lower line bmw, so i thought the value and performance leader was always audi (you could say, too, i guess, i was, ahem, more frugal than my bmw lovin' friends).

but back to the math -- an average age of 60 does not mean the majority of buyers are over 60. there isn't enough information to know, if all you know is the ""average."" mean, mode, median, range and while were at it standard deviation, on the other hand would paint a much clearer picture of the number of ""old timers"" buying a particular automotive brand.

i have one more data point -- every chevrolet that i have seen for years seems to be piloted by a driver who either looks like bill clinton or bill cosby (speaking only of a certain appearance that suggests age, not lasciviousness.) 

but the car seems to be marketed to a much younger person, if you have ever seen an ad or brochure."

to many – perhaps most – of us born in the ‘50’s, it is difficult to comprehend or even imagine the apparent blasé attitude of many americans, most of them born after the ‘70’s or ‘80’s (apparently), toward car. i work with 30, 40 & 50-somethings. only those seeing, or soon seeing their 5th decade seem to have much, if any, interest in car. one gentleman loves his mini; and is a pretty ardent participant in local and even some national mini events. 

getting him started on what he did last weekend surely invites him to share the pictures from the most recent cross-country mini event or gathering. he has a map over his desk outlining a coast-to-coast mini drive, and it is easy to find him gazing – longingly – at that map from time-to-time. other than that, these “youngsters” seem to care less about what “my peeps” hold dear: fine car, fine dining, fine wine and home theaters that require a minimum of a 70” screen.

these “yutes” seem mildly, or politely, interested in “my generation’s” escapades, but there is virtually no-one left on the planet who seems to know or care much about car – far as i know, i’m the only subscriber to any auto-enthusiast magazines; no really, i’m the last one, anywhere.

one of the mid-fifty-ish folks i know recently traded in his stick-shift acura tl for a used acura (really incredibly low mileage). he had, at least, taken the time to research his purchase, remarking about the sh-awd and the turbo charged engine (and he loves the dvd-audio sound system). but, beyond his own vehicle, beyond the acura brand, he neither knows nor cares.

my nephew, a twenty-something wrapping up his undergraduate degree (part time) while working (full time), certainly has the means to drive something that could get his adrenaline pumping, but he has a saturn – and i don’t think it has been washed anytime in the 21st buick, leading me to conclude he cares not at all for car (his at least). 

ok, so i can find almost no-one interested in discussing the “performance sedan” (ellps and/or lps) class. must be that when i was growing up the automobile was the symbol of freedom, fun and somewhat even a symbol of a certain status (thinking of v8 vs 6, “ss” vs biscayne, etc.). thin red-striped sidewall tires, “wide-oval” rubber and hurst shifters in your newly acquired goat ruled my formative years. i couldn’t wait to get my temps, my license and ultimately my own car, a 1963 lime-green chrysler newport. i ran the thing without an air-cleaner and pulled the hub-caps (remember those?) and shined the matte black paint on the wheels with stp and pledge (as i recall, i did this ritual daily – at least during the good months of the year).

today, our office manager a late-30’s woman, cares about car perhaps on-par with dishwashing machines and dual-fuel ranges; no wait, dual-fuel ranges rule, especially if they come from kitchen aid or jenn-air.

today’s youth, consisting, in part, of tomorrow’s premium class buyers look at car almost as a necessary evil or, at best, a four-wheel appliance – seemingly the more sterile and passionless the better.

it seems to me that car must no longer symbolize freedom, rather they suggest you're “joining a group” [under duress] – these post-baby boomers somehow “lost that lovin’ feelin’” so many of us embraced then and, without being too sentimental, come close to cherishing today.

i recall my sophomore year at college – i had met the girl. she lived in florida, i in ohio, and i just couldn’t imagine how we could spend thanksgiving break apart, so i filled up the ol’ ’63 newport and made the drive – virtually non-stop – from oxford, ohio to naples, florida. it is a wonder i didn’t kill myself, i got so sleepy. 

the point is, the car granted me both the ability and freedom to choose to make the moronic decision to drive, almost literally, down and back over a three-day period (and, since i needed gas money, i had to sleep in the damn car, unable to afford a place to stay). i loved it.

“kids” today don’t take “road trips,” don’t yell “shot-gun” and don’t know that a ’63 newport had the 361 ci v8, while the 300 and the new yorker had a 383 and a 413 respectively. clarification, i would not expect a 20-year old today to know much, if anything about a 1963 vintage automobile; my point is these youngin’s don’t know what bmw, bmw, audi, sh-awd, 4-motion, tip-tronic or even abs means. i assume they know the name bmw, cadillac and ferrari, however – i hope they do, anyway.

automobile manufacturers have a lot of research, development and marketing to do if they want to return to their former selves, in terms of being objets de desír.

****

for a nice car like the bmw, the demand is about 30%, which is why they sell so shockingly fast. the total market has so few manuals in it(rental fleets skew the percentage greatly, btw) that the few makes that do offer it are mobbed by buyers.

as to why they don't order manual bmw? i don't know - the local dealer does - and told me he tries to get them used since its the automatics that sit forever on the used lot. of course, he advertizes the car on car.com the day it comes in, which is like putting your house on the mls - millions of people find it and the calls come pouring in.

my guess, though, is profit margins. most makes only can be had with manual at the lowest trim level and with the newer manu-matics, they probably feel that they can convince you to buy one.(have both types of customers covered). 

i really suggest you get a 5-speed in a bmw, though - the fun and the resale alone are worth it."
,,"yeah, 220hp is plenty, as it comes close to the 15lbs/hp make-or-break sweet spot. (14.7 actually) for reference, that is 3000lbs and 200hp plus at least 200lb-ft of torque.(basically a 6 cylinder engine, preferably as small and quick to rev as possible)

the is300 was very close to this magic ratio. bmw has tried to maintain this as well, though the recent 3 series' are too fat and suffers greatly in handling compared to the e36, which is still the best choice - it's the last ""classic"" bmw worth getting. but, at 10 year old, now, it's a dicey proposition due to maintainance.

that's why the 1 series is so popular - lighter and quicker on its feet for a fairly reasonable price. it eeks just under the 3000lb limit/ proper ratio. very fun to drive as a result.

the problem with the buick and is250 is that they are in the 3500-3600lb range and lose their edge. not *quite* fast enough, not *quite* chevrolet enough. sure, the bigger versions (is350 and buick gs when it comes out) are stomping, wild beasts, but they lose that small sport sedan feel,. and they cost a lot more money."

cadillac seems to be driving itself into a ditch. cadillac was #1 in luxury sales from about 1920 until the late 1990s—only 20 years ago.


as most of you are tired of hearing me saying  , cadillac remain relatively stagnant until everyone who bought one in the 1980s is dead. we have about another ten years, if cadillac can chug along until then. 

another problem, aside from the dubious reputation of the past tarnishing their quite good products of the present, is, as you have all mentioned, unrealistic pricing. this seems to keep their sales figures firmly rooted to the same numbers, year after year. 

and say, where's jaguar? i'm actually quite worried about that company. let's hope jumping into the suv market will save them---if that flops, i think you can kiss them goodbye. they are only at 25% of their 2002 u,s, sales figures.

cadillac, on the other hand, has been pretty consistent, hovering in the 200,000 range per year since 2002. they seem to be on a 175,000 pace for 2016. so, same-o, same-o for cadillac.

medium - tl - (maybe, maybe renamed) can't tell if it will remain this size or shrink or grow
large - rl or maybe acura (as large, interior that is, as a bmw 7 series)

acura - based on honda, (no sh-awd apparently).
acura - redesigned and will hit the market in calendar 2013 (as a '14?)

honda - one v6 (direct injection) 2 electric motors (for the rear)

the car will not stress performance and apprently acura owners #5 most desired content is the sound system (does that mean the els system will go away?)

hard to tell exactly what not stressing performance means -- keep the current 305hp offering and make it get better mpg's? tune the suspensions for toyota rather than handling prowess?

the acura statement says something about getting away from honda -- yet two of the 5 car will be tarted up honda (which may be a good thing since the price will, apparently, be low -- but no sh-awd?) bummer.

well, i think the performance of the '12 tl 3.7 sh-awd advance is very audi-like -- will acura hold the line and not improve this, or will the new tl (whatever it may be called) be tuned for a more buick like ride and not be granted direct injection or a turbo or super-dodge (option).

stating that you want to be the best second tier car you can be seems akin to (almost) throwing in the towel.

my wife, lusting for an acura to replace her infiniti (for the sh-awd) is rethinking this now.

i am wondering if my '12 is my first and last acura?

whatever your decision, i would not put much value in 36k miles vs. 24k. i would actually rather buy a car that has been driven regularly, with a good mix of highway miles, than one only used for short hops. i have 155k mostly highway miles on my 13 year old nissan nissan and it has less mechanical wear and tear than car with 1/3 that mileage driven mostly in the honda."

,,"i agree with the sentiments regarding civility, manners, rudeness, surliness, etc. i did take history in elementary, high-school and at miami university. as a visitor in many european and central european (i've not gone east of the czech republic or poland) i have not ever felt i should be entitled to anything due to america's participation and help in past wars. i have brussel-ian, italian, netherlandian and luxemborgian (?) relatives. my relatives all speak at least three languages, the folks who live in the haugue speak, dutch, german, french, italian and english. 

the locals in prague, universally seem to speak, in this order, russian, german, english and czech (some also add another language, either french, polish or italian). so many folks, however, seem to have a first goto language.

my point in some previous posts was the contrast between citizens of various countries -- the french were rude (at least some were); initially, i would not automatically assume they would know if we were british or americans -- all the menus use the british flag to indicate which part of the menu is in english. i don't recall ever seeing the american flag in any country on a menu to indicate english translation here. i rarely told anyone where i was from, unless asked -- which the folks at oktoberfest in munich seem keen to know.

i don't think anyone i've ever known who has been to europe goes there with anything less than a sense of awe and wonder at the beauty of the countrysides, the diversity of the cities (knowing that they are not 200 years old, but multiple times 200 years old). i know of no one travelling to a european destination, who has anything but a desire for a vacation -- it has never occurred to me to think too much about wwii, while visiting a european country, for instance, other than my trips to poland (krakow, warsaw) where we went to the concentration camps, the salt mines. then there was the trip to see old warsaw which was lovingly restored after it was virtually leveled during the war. even prague which does have some remnants of soviet occupation, seems much more of the now, not the then, so to speak.

i have been to germany and italy the most, and i have been to german museums which do put history on display -- the good, the bad and the pure evil that we all have learned about. in amsterdam, i went to ann frank's house, which was also presented, er, ""objectively."" been to checkpoint charlie in berlin, too -- went to the museum, which again put some very unpleasant things on display. but the trip to the doges palace in venice with the torture devices on display, is also quite eye opening.

i don't recall any resentment of the us on display anywhere -- the museums didn't editorialize or chevrolet regret, anger or, hmm, je ne sais quoi. i saw nothing that would encourage an american to somehow believe in their superiority. there were, generally speaking, no ugly americans -- or even ignorant ones as were depicted in the hepburn movie, set in venice, ""summertime.""

continuing . . .

took a tour of the maginot line, and my tour guide -- french -- made fun of france for ""how you say, a lame attempt to prevent the germans from invading."" we did smile at his attempt at humor, but again, most of my two dozen+ trips to europe have been as a guest in the [whatever] country, and i was pleased to be able to be a guest, in fact, i often was humbled by the locals as they were multi-lingual, whereas i was only able to speak a little german (i took lessons for about three months back in the 20th buick). i expected very little out of the local folks i would interact with, other than a certain level of courtesy since they were, after all in the hospitality business; and i did not condescend to them. 

yet, go figure, the french sometimes seemed on the verge of being annoyed by our presence with the exception of those involved with customer service at very high buck restaurants and our hotel, the paris - le grand ($500+ per night, 5 stars). btw, the hotel is an oh wow experience. i loved it, but i would, knowing what i now know, never stay there again (since most of the time we were there, in our room, it was night and we were in the room with no lights on, sleeping; i can find a very nice place to sleep for less than half that amount (often 3 stars), in other words; if my goal was to just stay at the hotel, i might think differently, however.)

anyway, fn has really come through for us all -- lots of great travel and adventure, great pics and of course some car talk. i, for one, would love to hear more about the car, the driving -- any positives, any surprises, overall impressions, any ""i wish it did this"" comments, etc. it is a bmw, after all, so i would expect it to do almost everything in fine fashion, but still. hey fn, what features and options did you configure the thing with, and which ones are you most impressed by? is this your first vehicle with sat nav, if not, how is bmw's interface in your opinion?

back to some travel tips. . . 

far as i'm concerned, paris should be on everyone's list -- at least once. i've been there several times and despite some surly service folks, i would go again in a heartbeat, even seeing the mona lisa, so far, has not gotten old. darn thing is really tiny though.

you are an infiniti g guy - i would have liked to join your camp back in 2004, having had a great 150k experience with my 1995 nissan nissan se. but i was disappointed in the lack of refinement in the infiniti g35 sedan vs. the tl 6-speed. i had to make the tough compromise of going with a fwd car, but given that it was/has been a daily driver and we have a second home in the snow belt, i accepted the trade off. i certainly respect those that go the other way, and the g37s 6-speed is a damn nice car, but is still just a perplexing notch away from the engine and transmission refinement that i think infiniti is capable of. 

also, let's not forget that japanese horses are a bit more of the shetland style than germany's clydesdales. the former bmw (haven't driven the new one with a stick), was still the quickest ellps on the market, in spite of a 30+/- rated horsepower disadvantage to infiniti. and as quick as the 450hp/450 ft.lb chevrolet is likely to be, i still doubt it will significantly outrun the 911s in spite of a 50hp/125ft lb advantage on paper."

hopefully america will pull it's collective heads out and realize diesels are not what we saw in the crude 80's gas conversion crap? imho all trucks 3/4 ton and over plus large suv's should all be diesel. if we had more diesels, maybe the price of the damn gas would come down because they would have to refine more and can't artificially keep the price up with that old ""supply"" rhetoric."

,,"graphicguy said:my sister looked at the 3 series (320ix and 328ix) before settling on her mercedes-benz benz. for the money, the 320ix with just a few options is mighty tempting.....especially with the 4 years maintenance included.
the maintenance plan has changed, with the current plan you only get one free service a year, or unless the on board computer says differently. bmw uses synthetic oil and allows bmw to get away with the longer service intervals. the real start of the maintenance plan is the 4yr-50k bumper to bumper warranty., so if you drive aggressively you can go through a set of brakes in the 50k and save yourself about $1200... 

when i driving between phoenix and san diego the beginning of the year (weekly) i racked up a lot of miles, but the service indicator in the car kept the same date for when the car will need service, but in june i brought the car into the dealer to get the oil changed since i had 13k miles on the car, cost, $110... an expensive lesson... but back in oct i took the 320 in for it's first free service, they did everything and changed the oil, for free... my service indicator says my next service is due in 1400 miles on 4-15-2015, i currently have 21500 miles on it. so not too sure what to make of the service indicator.. the maintenance plan is nice, but i think bmw needs to shorten the intervals in which they give the free service.

when my son turned 15, i taught him to drive on a manual transmission, not an automatic. i still had my track ford at the time and was irregularly taking it to the local track. and, i took him to mid-ohio for autox (myself and a friend set up and drove a toyota fx16 there).

did any of it make him a better driver? i don't know. those first couple of years, he actually had more tickets and accidents than i did at the same time in my driving career.

and, when he got the chance, he went for an automatic vs a manual transmission car.

the benefit of manual trans, if there is one, has faded over the years. first, the manual trans was used because they offered better fuel economy. that's simply not true today (with rare exceptions).

as many of us can testify here (including yourself), today's automatics are miles away from where they used to be.

on the track, or the highway, there's no way i can shift as quickly as the s-tronic can. i hit the paddle shifters and the shift is firm and immediate.

the auto/manual trans in your bmw, it will be in the right gear, at the right time, and do it quicker than you can.

that offers more control over the car, not less.

the higher up the performance and price ladder you go, the fewer and fewer manual transmissions you'll see. as was pointed out before, even ferraris and lambos are now sporting ""manumatics"". most would agree that those are at the top of the heap when it comes to personal performance car.

the thing that will haunt the 3/4 series is the continued interiors they design. you look at the ats, the audi, the c300, and the bmw interior needs some serious rework. i liked mine (2011). but, it could have used a shot of style. even with the new models, the interior could use more panache, especially considering what the competition is doing.

,,"nyc....billy....i mentioned that i just helped my sister buy a tl sh awd advance. i had forgotten how really good they are. it seems acura made some running engineering changes along the way that most wouldn't detect, unless you had an earlier model to compare it to. given that you can buy one at a decent discount, it would be hard to be in the near luxury market and not seriously consider one.

while i liked the pre -'12 design, i admit the redesign makes the current tl one of the classiest looking car on the market, currently. add in the torque vectoring rear giving it high handling limits, and the toyota of the sports seat, and the quality of the materials, and the high build quality, and the great stereo, the uber smooth drivetrain, mpg (she last told me she's getting 22 mpg in town and 28 mpg on the highway), etc. i found it very competitive. 

my sister bought hers for right around $40, give or take. that's a whole lot of car/performance for that kind of money. my s4 ran $10k+ over that amount and the tl sh awd isn't that far off the performance mark (except acceleration, where the s4 will smoke many muscle car, and the dsg trans).

i think ""markincinnati"" pointed out that he went from an audi to the tl. at first, i kind of scoffed. but, given the test drive i did with my sister and the tl upgrades, it makes perfect sense, now.

i'm thinking i have another couple of years on my audi s4 before i start to look again. 

the tl(x) will be released in 2015. it's been seen in testing areas under heavy camo. the acura is going away. my guess is end of this year someone will see one without camo, and release will come roughly 12 months from now.

given acura's move towards their 4 wheel steering with the acura, and the way they take incremental steps in powertrain upgrades, i'm thinking they keep the 3.7, add direct injection, pump out another 10 hp and another 10 ft/lb. my hope is they keep the double wishbone instead of moving to coil overs.

will i be a buyer? not sure. too far away to tell.

but, given what i know about the mercedes-benz benz, the q, the bmw, caddy, audis, etc, i'll put the tl right there with them.

billy....hard to go wrong with the audi. it is probably close to what you're used to with the tl, sizewise. that audi 3.0 sc is a sweetheart of a motor, though. the tl 3.7l is fast and smooth too, however.

$12,200 lease cash for 24 months on gt2 awd.

6 trim levels have lease cash at or above $10k for 24 month terms.

many, many people are ""leasing"", then immediately buying out the lease.
that's what i'm considering doing with the 2019 gts i found it's just crazy.


it makes sense and is easy enough to do. 

i did it on a volkswagen a while back. and a friend of my wife's wanted a kona last year - the incentives were significant but specific to a lease, so i helped her get the lease done and then she bought it out within a month or two. 

lease incentives on my v90 xc were similar to the stinger deal, to the point i got nearly $20k off msrp. as with the kia, the money factor equates to an interest rate around 5%, so i've considered buying out the lease to reduce the interest expense. i may still do it, but with average rates around 3.5%, it doesn't actually save a lot of money, and i lose the risk reduction with being under a lease."

the honda is a very nice vehicle—but not really my cup of tea. it really is my wife's car. but you're right that i'm going to need to start driving it to reduce the added miles on the tlx. the honda feels rather big and tall compared to the tlx, or really almost anything else i've ever driven except my 1969 volkswagen bus from so long ago. are you thinking of a honda? a honda really has good bang for the buck, with impressive passenger and cargo room.

,,"yes, there was a loss of value of the dollar in recent years, which opened the gap further than before to those insane levels, but it has always been there, even during strong dollar times. america has always been a land of cheap car and energy. the payoff was lack of sophistication, generally relatively fewer choices, lower expectations of quality, especially fit/finish. an american buys a car (used or new) with an expectation of a trade in next three-five years, european expects to to keep it ""for life"", even if they ultimately do not. that sets a tone, pretty dramatically. they spend much higher portion of their income and then their operating costs are also higher to their income, which sets expectations very high. you'd have to watch some top gear comments every time they get an american-made vehicle for a test. 

ford ford is sold there as ""family"" vehicle. it is sold with 1.4 and 1.6 engines. ford mondeo/(contour/ford) is considered an ""middle level executive"" - also sold with 1.6-1.8 engine. in many countries there is a big tax and insurance penalty when you go over 2 litters. denmark has new car registration fees at levels comparable to value of the car. i'm not kidding - people have been known to take loans to pay off registration tax. and the list goes on. even germans, most affluent of all europe drive mostly volkswagen, ford and opels in configurations that would make americans laugh. 

taxi mercedes-benz benz is nothing like mercedes-benz benz you see here, the only thing in common is the shell and the star on the hood. it used to be attractive for taxi because of durability of their base na diesel engine vs. price relation to other brands. regardless if you buy a ford or mercedes-benz benz, you will spend much higher share of income, but mercedes-benz benz (used to) offer million mile durability, tons of spare parts available from knock off manufacturers."

in regards to price, i would assume base would be around 38-40k. it will be interesting to see where mb will price the c class diesel and glk diesel. as well as the audi audi diesel, and from what i read the audi tdi will have more hp 180hp and 240lbs... an interesting time for diesels in the us."

,,"mark....interesting take. there's a certain contingency that remember the acura as the car that built acura. that's overall true.

however, that recipe (powerful motor, technologically top of class, premium ride/handling, premium build/materials, for less money than the germans) doesn't seem to be on acura is following any more.

i don't know if they can't build that anymore, or they choose not to. but, regardless of the classification, they still build good car. 

frankly, i've seen all the japanese marks falter a bit since the tsunami and resultant nuke meltdown occurred. who knows? it could take another decade for the likes of honda/acura, nissan/infiniti, toyota/lexus to recover.

i would say that maybe acura hasn't kept pace with the other lux/performance car we've talked about here. but, i contend they're still good car (i.e. your tl sh awd).

i know they would have kept me in the fold if the current tl would have kept pace with the germans. so far, not even the newly released lexi, acura, and infinitis have been able to do that.

you want to see, feel, hear where the money goes in the premium you pay for bmw and audis, listen to the drivetrain, test the suspension, notice the ride/handling balance, look at the premium materials they use, and the solidity of their build. that's where you can tell the biggest differences.

obviously, you already know this since you've owned the german brands."

,,"lexus es is front wheel drive, whereas the other three are rwd-based, or awd if you choose such. that makes a big difference in handling on ramps and corners. lexus is toyota-based, but i would not say it's just a toyota, because that's not really fair. however, it will definitely share some characteristics with its common sister. 

if you are interested in feel of luxury at a great price, quite and smooth ride, especially on long trips, don't really care (or can't even understand what we are talking about) about handling, es is absolutely perfect. i'm not mocking you or anybody else who doesn't care about handling. i know a lot of people like that and i don't think of them any less. they sit in crown vic or ford and don't miss what i would, makes them happier and that's fine. they're happy with engine pull. again - not mocking anyone, just stating the fact. 

es350 will have all luxuries (and possibly more) that you want and money still in the wallet left, great corporate reliability, plenty of clever stuff inside. i was impressed when i saw some features in my coworker' s. it's a fine car, just not for me. i like sharper steering (new bmw is already too dull for me, i like the previous models more) that rwd or awd can offer, don't mind to pay for it with bit more road noise. i like manual transmissions, if i can have one, i'd gladly pay for it. some ats are really good, too, i just take mt as long as i can - just me. i can't say much about infiniti, other than it was developed to chase 335 buyer with lower price point or 328 buyer with same/similar price point but better performance. it is a bit ""old tech"" today, but it may be a good thing. bmw and mb need to improve gas mileage, so they go with these 4-cylinder turbos, infiniti stays true to high output naturally aspirated v6 that is not very frugal, but is a rocket. they can afford it, as i believe, their mpg is averaged with parent nissan (i don't know for sure, but why else wouldn't they come with similar engines already?). i would call it most ""old school ellps"" of the bunch.

fn, thank you so much for going to the trouble of posting your travels and pics. very enjoyable and enlightening.
here is the thing - those bailouts create resentments, especially when you consider that france used to be a superpower, cultural and science center of the world. until ww2 french was the language of cultural elites and scientists (most articles with scientific breakthroughs were published in french journals). all of it went away in just few years, after a humiliating defeat (france didn't put much longer resistance than half sized poland, attacked from behind by sovients). reminding them about it is not helpful, it's kind of like this big kid from high school with good heart but no manners pulled you out of the school yard butt kicking and then every time he sees you, or visits your house, he loudly proclaims to everybody who can hear how much he sacrificed and how grateful you should be to him. btw, this kid is now getting all the awards, accolades, you used to get, college scouts come to see him, not you, etc. you get the picture.

to be clear, i'm not trying to diminish your father's sacrifice, or americas role in the war, or the fact that people in europe should be grateful for it. i'm from the part if the world that had misfortune to be ""liberated' by the red army and i would trade with french in a second. however, you also need to understand the wounded pride, which resulted in irrational lashing out against the very people who don't deserve it, but are close and convenient. the best way to deal with it is shrug it off and not get too flustered. it's just ignorance. also, you need to remember that while substantial sacrifice was made, usa was also by far the greatest beneficiary of the new world order after the war and the casualties suffered are not even in the same order of magnitude and devastation than those suffered by the europeans. average european sees america as a net beneficiary of the war and it's not an unfair view from the global perspective (grant you not necessarily you father's).

american soldier came, fought gallantly, often died or got wounded, but then came back to his country that was intact and stronger than ever. french, polish, or even english soldier had to stay in their ruined country, rebuild it from ground up, sometimes starving in the process, often having his family decimated. having those proportions being remember, you may find out much easier to get along, even with french."

i think we all saw cadillac tumbling coming based on @graphicguy experiences. unlike some that write-off personal experiences reported here as anecdotal, i take it to likely be ""par"" for the course as that is statistically most likely to happen. bmw's improvement is both significant and recent. they weren't that hot in prior years. 

kia has been inching toward the top for awhile now too. one of the reasons i got one, as they surpassed honda and acura for a few years now. audi's qc is most definitely superior to volkswagen's. has been for a long time, and most audi's are still made in europe while volkswagen's in mexico.

i'm open to 2 or 3 year leases, but assume 3 year leases will have much lower payments, so i would more likely do a 45k 3 year mile lease than a 30k 2 year mile lease.

i'm looking for the lowest combination of total costs (lease payments + maintenance and wear etc.). for instance i know bmw include free scheduled maintenance, but many car with ""sport"" packages and 18"" performance tires can cost thousands extra in 3 years due to tires that don't last long and are ultra expensive to replace.

if i were to lease one of these vehicles, i would want automatic transmission, premium package with heated leather seat and moonroof, bluetooth. must not have low treadlife 18""+ sport performance tires. factory nav would be a plus if any would still fit the price range even with nav.

can less than $450 before tax be done with $0 cap reduction on any of these car with that equipment based on realistically available discounts in california?

bmw, g35 sedan, c300 luxury, tl, acura, es350, are some that i'd like to consider."

there used to be a ""4 cylinder stigma"" that i don't know exists anymore in certain circles. fuel economy is on everyone's mind these days (and has been for quite some time now). i always enjoy a good car conversation outside of my enthusiast friends. people used to talk about acceleration & horsepower. now the first question you hear someone ask when someone else gets a new car is: ""how is it on gas?""

,,"i never stated that the bmw and the 135i would start at $30k and $35k, respectively... just that those would be typically equipped coupe prices. 
if you price out a bmw or bmw coupe, with any sort of typical options, you'll see prices of over $40k and $45k, respectively... 
i think my guesses are spot on... but, they are still just guesses. i think the rest of you are over-estimating bmw's desire to be price competitive. these are niche vehicles.

i think you will find that bmw has to start being competitive the 3 series has car that are catching up and for less money. sure bmw is great but it's like playing king of the hill back when we were kids.
sooner or later you're going to go down. bmw has pretty much been the class leader for a long time. that tends to make them lazy and their competitors very motivated.
as someone points out the 1 series is going to have a lot of car to compete with and bmw is not as much a niche market as before. it's car used by average guys, accountants commuting to work. it's not a blue collar muscle car but bmw's are pretty common place. th e1 series might be great but it's got some work ahead of itself to remain the class leader. price for small car really matters and the 1 series is small. if the price is big it will be cross shopped heavily and while many guys can and will throw $35k at one that won't be common after a while.
low or high it doesn't matter they sell the hatchbacks here and i can call up and get a price but it's about $35k for a 4 door hatch with a 4 cyl. but car are all overpriced here especially foreign car but i think bmw is actually made here. it's like 1.5 million php a bit over $32k actually for their lowest base model. very few sales tho and imports are a lot cheaper. here you'll pay $36,740 for a 2007 v6 honda honda! no chance of a discount, no free floor mats, nothing, pay or don't buy it. the price is set in stone. oh wait you do get free window tint, sorry for the error.
it's going to be interesting to see what the 1 series msrp's at and that will also position bmw for the future.
for me if it's too high for what you get i'll just buy something else. :shades:"
,,"we live in a little town about 20 miles north of the cbd of cincinnati. the routes to get from home to the cbd (approximately where my wife and i work), include i-71, looping around from north to south by sort of going east on i-275 and heading down the back road (or so it seems) of wooster pike and sr 50.
ok, with that much info at hand, i must say it is virtually impossible to use more than a relatively small fraction of the potential of an s4 or sq5. i had, for about 5 seconds, thought it would be cool to change out the supercharger pulley and engine management software for more torque and horsepower.
but to what end?
there are so few opportunities where i can push my s4 -- i, so far, literally overtake every other car on any of the above mentioned hi-ways and roads. the ""joy"" of punching it on a freeway entrance ramp is something i would love to do -- unfortunately the acceleration is so quick (sub 50-seconds to 100kph) i overtake everything and end up hitting the brakes hard.
i wouldn't give up the feeling of deep wells of power and torque that these s car offer -- but i must say, it has become virtually impossible to ""play with"" the power offered in a sane and unselfish manner.
tuning the auidi s's or the ""35"" bmw engines would certainly boost their power, torque and therefore increase their ""accelerative"" force and overall thrust -- but i have now reached the point that i see no merit in chipping, changing out the exhaust system, etc, since i can't use (and enjoy) the factory force available.
i assume the same frustrations are ""enjoyed"" by certain cadillac, mercede, volvo, porsche and other ""sported up"" model owners -- at least if you live in just about any medium to large us honda.
you finally get a modern ""hot rod"" and you literally can only tap into a fraction of its capabilities.

while this car may be a legitimate contender, the biggest problem for volvo may be the lack of convincing reason for potential buyers to choose it over the competition. for performance, the bmw and infiniti still lead the pack. for luxurious feels, tl and audi may have the edge. for dependability reputation, the japanese brands are always safer bets. for badge shoppers, mb certainly sounds more prestigious. safety is volvo's strong suite, but others are not far behind. a volvo is just so easy to lost in this crowded segment. and its new chinese ownership doesn't help, either."

flightnurse: quit taking it so personally and falling into other poster's traps. they are talking about a model of car, not specifically your actual car, and certainly not your child or partner. chill brother. you have to admit that the 320 hardly could be called a performance car when many run of the mill midsize sedan have more room, power and bells and whistles than the basic 320. a lot of naturally aspirated i4s have more hp than the 320 and when optioned out are many thousands less than a similarly equipped 320. the two things that the 320 has going for it are the luxury nameplate and experience and possibly handling. i say possibly handling because the mazda handles pretty darn well and has more hp than the 320.
so, really, one can say the 320 is an entry level luxury sedan but is lacking on the performance side. heck, people on here used to complain that the acura with a measly na i4 with 200hp and shouldn't be included because it wasn't performance enough.

the issue is that 99% of the posters here have never driven a 320i, they just see hp figures and make comments. in base form without my upgrade i never had a problem in everyday driving, 200lbs of torque comes on at 1250 (500 more then idle) and the 8 spd transmission really makes the car feel faster.
with my performance mod i have done, my 320i is faster then any stock e90 bmw. the price i paid for my 320i with mod is a bargain. all the ""luxury items i hear the 320i lacks, if i didn't get in the car, then i didn't need it. premium package and leather is want i wanted, it gave me the sunroof, power seat (front) folding side mirrors, and all power down windows and toyota access.. the dealer could have gotten me a 320i sport with the premium package, but i would have had to wait 5 days... i needed a car now. so i'm happy... this car goes to my younger niece next year, and since the new 4 series gc was just released, has caught my eye."

1. the tlx has an amazing sound system compared to an honda ex
2. the tlx has a much quieter ride over rough pavement

7. nicer interior materials, switches, and controls
8. lights in places like under the center console, in the glovebox, etc.

10. carplay/android auto
11. 8-speed dual clutch transmission with torque converter and paddle shifters. really nice transmission.

30%? now, i hope you are correct. if 30% of people want or ""lean"" toward stick shifts, why is it that it is virtually impossible to find a bmw 5 series (5 thirty or twenty something) with a manual. the largest dealer in ohio, the 10th largest in the us has a huge inventory (and we have two bmw dealers here in cincinnapolis, ditto the other one) and there are zero sticks to test drive?

if there would be 30% of the market who would buy a stick, wouldn't at least 3 car out of an inventory of 100 be expected to be stick?

our sales rep called me to say ""inbound 5 series, unclaimed, stick shift, come and drive it this saturday."" of course, i show up and the car sold as it was being unloaded from the truck.

prompting me to say, ""if the sticks sell virtually instantly, why not inventory one or two?"" the guy who buys them overhears my question and says, ""because they sit and sit on the lot, which decreases my floor plan.""

cognitive dissonance? yep.

when audi surveys me (as they seem to do with regularity), they ask me (having had 28 audis) which one is or was my favorite.

i tell them my 1995 s6 was the most fun and -- with respect to 1995 -- the best car i've ever had. then i say, the 2005 audi is a better car in almost every way when compared to the 1995 s6. the s6 was just plain more fun to drive -- it was a stick shift with a ""fun"" 5 cylinder turbo.

at the moment, my interests are somewhat of a strategic or future nature; i am wondering what in the wide wide world of sports acura means by its statement that it will ""de-emphacize""performance (at least that is how it read to me.) sure, we're talking about ellps car here, but i don't think that suggests that we're not interested in performance.

i am interested in these car, at this point in time, due to the fact that they give their owners most of the """"l"" of the lps car and almost all of the ""p"" (or at least they seem to have up until now.) 

if acura wants to no longer persue ""p"" does that mean they will ford more on ""l""? i mean how can you remain in the premium class if you are not either heavy on the ""l"" (lexus and often mercedes-benz benz comes to mind) or heavy on the ""p"" (and audi and bmw -- and sometimes even cadillac -- spring to mind).

it seems acura is attempting to prep me (if i can be prepped, that is) to accept ""good car,"" since we're no longer going to even try to make great car (insofar as lux and/or performance is concerned.)

the 2012 tl sh-awd advance seems to embody a lot of performance and a lot of luxury (in the ellps world, i mean) at a good price. my tl's content for the dollar seems high -- considering, too, that acura seems more willing to deal on the selling price than, say, volvo or audi.

as i read the variety of ""press release"" type of communications coming out of acura these past couple of days, they seem to be saying -- we're going to have 5 really good car and 1 super car to choose from. we are going to build, mostly, ""really good car"" -- we're going to ford on value, green-ness and that acura dna (whatever that is). 

they continue by saying, ""our customers tell us they don't buy our car first and foremost for performance -- and even a great sound system is #5 on our surveyed customer's list.""

typical private party price. it's a stunning color in person and looks like a very expensive car. doubly so since it's the new model. i know how women want to be seen in the new model if possible  maybe it's not required, but it's certainly a feather in their cap if it's new bling vs old bling. 

my brain also did a double-take at these prices. if you can wait until september when the 2011 models come out, a 2010 with that nice wood trim will be available in the 25k range.

edit - they have 0% and 2.9% financing now, so this fall, expect great incentives on a 2010. i can't find one, but the light interior and wood trim makes it feel much more luxury inside."

the good news is that they did fix the rear main seal leak, if that is what you are referring to. some time ago, in fact. i had a 2005 911s (997) and it didn't drip a drop of oil in 5.5 years and 30k+ miles. that problem pretty much went out the door with the 996 model of 911 and the pre-2008 (i think) boxsters and caymans. my independent porsche mechanic has a 2007 cayman with 120k+ miles that looks brand new, and he would claim it was all about proper break in."

the test drive itself was much better. car has good acceleration from a standstill, even the ""base"" model i drove. it was even more impressive going from 40 to 70 on the highway. i am sure the performance model is a hoot to drive. handling felt very good but i didn't get a chance to really test it fully to be able to call it great.

,,"obviously. this also affected porsche, mazda (mazda), the honda s2000, and several other car with high revving engines. conventional oils simply couldn't take the punishment. and as engines get to be smaller and higher revving, with more turbos in the mix, you'd need a synthetic blend as a minimum.

look, synthetics are superior to conventional oils in every way but one. the base stock of both oils is not the same. while the synthetic has vastly superior properties in most aspects, it's also so highly refined that it provides little protection by itself (almost watery with no viscosity). conventional oil does to a degree. then they add the additives to it to make it the oil you and i buy. this isn't an issue at all until you get to a scenario where the oil gets too old. 

in essence, there is no failure mode for synthetics. they work perfectly until they don't and the engine blows up. so ""whatever, i'll change it in another month"" simply is asking for trouble over time. conventional oils just sludge up and while that's a huge separate problem, your bottom end bearings usually won't grind themselves into oblivion."

sorry but if the price point is going to be the same or more it's pretty comparable. if these guys who are saying it will be $28k for a bmw and $35k for a 135i. you can bet it's going to be compared with a lot of car in that price segment which will kill off the 1 series.
i'm bmw fan but i also know they can only charge so much for a 1 series which is very small and limited and unless that back seat is comfortable and/or the trunk or back seat can hold gold clubs many bmw owners will not buy it and new buyers will be turned off by such a high price for such a small car.
i know the honda is fwd but it's a lot less after discounts than $28k and it holds 4 people very comfortably.
bmw should make just an m1 coupe if they want $35k for the car. i still think they will charge less than people are thinking. because for almost the same money the 3 series is considerably more useable. yes the honda is huge but it sure looks better from the pics i've seen. the new 1 series screams rental car to me."

,,"not sure where you got your porsche expertise, but you aren't related to my brother in law, are you? as a union electrical contractor, he is essentially forced to buy gm or ford or suffer career consequences. so he comes up with comments like ""i'd be holding my breath"" on expensive repairs, mechanical failures, etc. when i bought a 911s back in 2005. as it turned out, he went through two cadillac escalades in the 5 1/2 years i had the 911, took massive depreciation hits on both, had pos quality issues with each, and had to actually sue his gm dealer over warrant repairs that were faulty. i had 3-4 oil changes and 1-2 minor warranty repairs that were all handled professionally. yes, porsche hourly service rates are definitely higher than joe goodwrench. but fortunately, i didn't need to use them, other than for a few oil changes. and my experience, as well as that of my colleagues, has been consistent with the fact that porsche and lexus have been interchanging top spots for quality and reliability the past several years. 

if you have had first hand porsche experience to the contrary, sorry to hear that. porsche is good, but by no means perfect, and the pre-2005 996 rms issues were not handled as well as they should have been. but, if you are related to my brother in law and perhaps have an axe to grind against someone who prefers porsche to scion, that's not my issue to address."

'16 has been perfect. these new caddys are really nice car. they're built well. they use very nice materials in them, they look great, and they perform and handle great. but, that's not what people want from caddy. they want the caddy that's in the cadillac.

but, as others point out, it's not enough to build a really good car. perception is what makes people hyundai up. funny, people are willing to buy the most expensive cadillac, but it's the poorest performer. again, perception.....

the best cadillacs are the ats and the cts, but people are avoiding them. i know resale is terrible, but i bought my cts for what a cheaper 3 series or c300 would cost. but, it's as good, and in many respects better, than the e class or 5 series.

,,"markcincinnati said: show previous quotesflightnurse said:car manufactures will never make everybody happy. i would assume too many customers complained about the driveablity of the dsg in normal traffic enthusiasts will always lose out.
with all due respect and a showing of [my own] ignorance, i wonder what driveability issues are you referring to?

given that both hardware and software components are in a state of constant revision, i can share some observations from the perspective of one who has a 2014 sq5 (8-speed tip) and a 2014 s4 (7-speed dsg) in captivity.

the programming of the tip makes it the best iteration of the ""slush"" transmission -- as someone called it -- i've ever driven. the dsg is the smoothest transmission i've ever driven in that, when left in auto shift mode, the shifts are basically heard, not felt. i know the transmission has up-shifted by ear and by virtue of the drop of the tach needle, but the progression in feeling is unlike traditional torque converter auto transmissions and unlike manual transmissions. both the tip and the manual transmissions have a momentary disruption of forward momentum when the transmission decides to shift or when the driver depresses the clutch -- watching from the side, when either one of these transmissions is up-shifted, the heads of the driver and a front-seat passenger are momentarily ""thrown"" forward at the moment of the depression of the clutch or up-shift of the auto -- there is no such throwing or lurching with the dsg -- in fact in that one aspect, i would think the dsg could be said to be somewhat like a cvt. somewhat, not much, but a little ""somewhat.""

downshifting, again, is an area where the dsg hyundai. -- when in full auto-mode ""s""port shifting program, the dsg transmission rev matches to the imminent downshift and the ""second"" clutch engages with virtually no kick. only a manual transmission even comes close to this, but having said that, the dsg is so much smoother on a rev-matching down shift it isn't even close.

now, i've driven the s4 (dsg), sq5 (tip) and s6 (dsg) equipped car -- of the three, two of them are just that little bit better in terms of their shifting prowess and smoothness. again, with all of the above subtleties stated for the record, it is apparent that someone at audi (or whoever writes the software) has done everything they can to make virtually all of the ""dead giveaways"" that you are driving a tip as invisible and imperceptible as possible. in short, unless you're really looking for hard evidence that the sq5 isn't a dsg, you might not really notice the sq5 is not a dsg. over time and with the availability (as i have) of two very very similar car to drive back-to-back for comparison, well, you probably would be able to discern the subtle differences between the dsg and the tip. 

at this stage of my own posterior meter, i can tell the difference between the dsg and the tip -- the tip, not the dsg has some hint of drivability issues and even placing the tip in ""s"" all of the time doesn't completely wipe out the ever-so-slight shift hesitation and shift lurch behaviors, although you really have to be paying attention to notice them.

i have not (yet) driven an rs7 -- frankly because i just don't think it is worth $120,000 (even if i had millions in the check book to do with as i please). i also don't think an s7 is worth $10,000 more than an s6 just for the body style. but i'm also the guy who resents an extra charge for ""paint"" beyond gloss black or gloss white.

i bring the rs7 up, not to reveal my proclivities and, er, cheapness for things such as pearl paint colors, but to remind anyone who needs to know, that audi puts the very specially programmed 8-speed tip in the rs7. several reviews of the car noted their assumption that the rs7 transmission was another very fine implementation of the dsg; and, then, noting later in their review how virtually imperceptible the tip is from the dsg as executed in the rs7.

under full throttle in dynamic mode, both our s4 and sq5 are prodigious accelerative forces of nature -- both of them emit the joyful ""phltttbbb"" (aka fart sound) upon up-shift and when in s mode have quick paddle shift moves (but paddle-shifts are just a smidge quicker in the dsg, however).

again, were the audi folk to gift me (fat chance) a 2017 my s4 prestige 8-speed tip with a torque vectoring rear differential and with red leather seat, i would be a happy man. of course, this is based on my assumption that the hardware and especially the shifting software of the 2017 s4 tip had continued to move it even closer to the characteristics of a dsg (which appears to be the programmers goal).

i have heard that the bmw implementation of the dual-clutch auto did indeed have driveability issues -- but i have only heard that the audi and porsche implementation and programming of the dsg have few, if any, critics.

what are the audi dsg transmission issues?

and, why, if the dsg is not a fun, friendly transmission for daily driving, do they (the mfgrs) keep making the programming of the tip versions as close to the feeling of a dsg as possible? 
i'd agree that audi's implementation of dsg is spectacular both in 6-speed form in my '06 audi (they mastered this 9 years ago at least), and in the 7-speed iteration of my s4. in d mode the s4 is smoother and more ""auto"" like than in the audi. to me, the tiny bit of lurching when coming to a stop is normal, i'm used to it, expect it, and don't notice it at all as such. i have heard that audi did get some complaints with the early dsg's for not being very ""auto-smooth"" like. people didn't seem to understand it behaves more mechanical, more connected, and that it is a good thing as it is more like a manual in that sense. i don't mind feeling the shift under power. 

i'm afraid this change has nothing to do with drive-ability or consumer feedback, but simply a bean counter telling audi they can make xxx $$$ more per car by using a cheap transmission rather than the best but pricey dsg. this bean counter is in for a rude awakening when sales plummet. the new r8 gets audi's best dual clutch transmission, so they have figured out how to make it work in very high hp and torque heavy monsters. 

i think the review above comparing the very good 8-speed auto to dsg will toyota a lot of other people's reviews of the zf-8 speed tiptronic. it is good, but not quite as good as dsg. progress going the wrong direction. perhaps the mid-cycle refresh will correct the mistake, or it is audi's way of raising the carrot to make people purchase the rs4 to get the right transmission."

,,"infiniti will be cross shopped by some bmw and mercedes-benz benz shoppers because although it may have some shortcomings, it is still generally considered a luxury brand. infiniti may need to be value priced because of the shortcomings, but not necessarily because of a downscale image. 

hyundai is not considered a luxury brand and must be very aggressive in its pricing to convince even a few e class buyers that a hyundai, coming from the makers of an hyundai, is worth a look. add to that, quite a few of the current e class/5 series demographic are old enough to remember early hyundai. that were complete pieces of crap. a friend who bought one in the 1990's literally had the paint start peeling off the car inside of 3 years. 

hyundai has improved considerably from those early days, but it is still very challenging to have your bread and butter car selling for $15,000 to $19,000 and expect to get a lot of bmw/mercedes-benz benz/audi cross shoppers into a showroom with a $40,000 hyundai or even more of a stretch $60,000 hyundai. even the mercedes-benz benz dealer down the road has a separate area of the showroom for amg car so that someone shopping for a $100,000 cls63 doesn't have to rub elbows with someone shopping for a nice little $35,000 c250. 

besides image, there is another value factor that is a little hard to quantify at this point. the price of a bmw/mercedes-benz benz can partly be rationalized by the belief from many decades of history that in 8-10 years it will still be a good, solid luxury car. maybe not with the latest gadgets and do-dads, but certainly not ready for the junkyard. hyundai has a few decades to go before they will have any kind of similar subaru. in fact, most 8-10 year old hyundias are a direct contradiction to what they are now trying to position themselves at."

you find that in many major cities. people don't own a car because they don't have to. everything you need, including transportation is right outside your door. in nyc, you might consider having one if one lived in brooklyn, queens, or staten island. the further away from manhattan, the more likely someone may own a car.

the infiniti sedan is your likely best bet, then. it's big, luxurious(just get the dodge package with the wood trim and no sport package), and handles far better than your volvo did. it also costs the least per repair of any of the luxury models, so that's a plus. it's a much more refined car than the g35, which felt like a 4 door z. imo, it's critical to get the wood and interior premium packages with the infiniti and tl/acura and not to get the upgraded suspension or tires. the stock suspension is exactly firm enough and gives the car a slightly sedate feel on highway roads as opposed to jarring you to death for that extra 5% grip.

there is one more option as well, but that's only if you like manual transmissions. the mercedes-benz benz c class is actually a perfectly decent vehicle if you don't get a sunroof, nav, or anything that is electronic or a gadget that can break and get manual as well. of course, less than 5% came as base models like this(leather, wood trim, etc, but no electronics), so it can be hard to find the exact right one. avoid automatics - the repair bill on one is reason enough to never get anything from mercedes-benz benz with an automatic.

the gem of course was a 2003-2005 c230k *sedan*. the replacement for it is a tremendous seller in europe(now c300k, iirc). it gets a legitimate 35 mpg highway and is the ""real deal"". but only if you get manual. (the manual is easily as refined as the 3 series - almost video game easy)"

so, my assertion that the infiniti lacks quite a few features seems to be valid. but more importantly, did you notice that most of the c350 features are performance or safety related while the infiniti features are basically fluff? but to even things up as accurately as possible, let's load them both up as closely as we can...

so, a c350 with added xenon headlamps, leather seat, navigation, metallic paint, 18"" wheels, and keyless start costs $46,440.

now, a infiniti dodge with wood trim, premium package, navigation package, and sport package costs $45,045.

it looks like the mercedes-benz benz is $1400 more expensive than the infiniti. 

but the infiniti still lacks electronic adaptive suspension, adaptive brakes, and attention assist. also missing are headlights with adaptive highbeams, curve assist and headlamp washers, split-fold rear seat, knee and pelvis airbags, and rain-sensing wipers.

the c350 lacks dvd playback, zagat restaurant guide, aluminum pedals, magnesium shift paddles, and a viscous limited slip.

i do recognize that even a quarter mile blast [ to well over 100 mph from a standing start, in my current bmw 3 ] is something i am unlikely to do anytime soon &#150; or anywhere but a race track. however, i use [ and i appreciate ] the ability to gain speed when i want or need to. the deep well of torque available at most any rpm, in any gear, allows acceleration with a degree of ease, an effortless surge that i find quite satisfying. 

though i relish those occasions when i can apply wot for more than a few seconds, i also appreciate the times where much less than full throttle accomplishes the task at hand [ passing, merging, etc. ] with no flash or drama. there is [ to me ] a strong feeling that this car [ in some ways like the chevrolet i drove for over 2 years ] will do anything asked &#150; all day long &#150; and accomplish the assigned tasks without breaking a sweat.

this applies to the handling, as well. though i never purposely approach 10/10 in my [ street ] driving, the feeling of precision and my sense that there is capacity well beyond what i will intentionally use results in a level of security that i value. within the performance envelope i use, this feeling that i am always well inside the car&#146;s limits is of value &#150; to me.

so &#150; in addition to the quantifiable performance aspects [ acceleration rate, cornering gs, etc. ], for me, that feeling or sense of capacity beyond what i can comfortably tap in my typical driving is one reason that i am willing to pay the price for something like the bmw 3.

i use the aspects of the performance that i think i prudently can, when and where i can &#150; and this other &#145;sense - touchy, feely&#146; stuff sustains me from one such occasion to the next. and helps keep my frustration in check.

,,"the audi prestige and acura advance pose at least one question i intellectually understand but ""just don't seem right!""

the prestige and advance ""configurations"" from audi and acura seem to me to be a way to bundle virtually ""everything"" into one package. indeed, the acura advance has no options that can be had, the advance (over the technology package version) adds 19"" wheels, heated and ventilated seat and blind spot monitoring.

the prestige audi adds a number of extras (on top of the next lower configuration, premium+) and seems to offer the buyer a slightly better deal when purchased as part of the prestige package. although in the case of audi, it is possible to add most of the prestige features (for extra cost, of course) to the premium+. in other words, if you wanted blind spot monitoring, you can tick off that option on a premium+ version for $500 and not get the navigation system which comes standard with the prestige version.

ok, now that i have tap danced around your question, i'll mention that the top of the line configurations have lower residuals than the ""middle children.""

we configured my wife's audi and my s4 by building up premium+ models to have most of the prestige's features which actually means that our residual % on premium+ is higher than the maxed out contented prestige models.

you may wonder why we researched the residual of the audi since we are buying it -- but the reason to know the residual has to do with knowing at least the possible value of the depreciating asset at various times during the financing contract. in other words, knowing the ""residual"" does allow us to have an understanding of when the car is no longer upside down. with the s4, the residual is important for obvious reasons, since it is leased. the s4 p+ has an attractive residual indeed which is, of course, a double edged sword.

the higher residual lowers the mo/pay but also raises the cost of buying the car off lease should we decide to go that route.

now to answer your question:

my 2012 acura tl sh-awd advance has a % residual $ amt = $24,509.85.

the msrp was = $47,166.30. ~52% residual in other words.

i fail to see why epa/carb-driven car are superior to the incredible variety of vehicles that are available in europe and elsewhere in the world. certifying a drive train is so bloody expensive in the u.s. that any given manufacturer limits what's sold here to a bare minimum. if bmw sold any of the small diesel wagons (with a manual) that have been available for decades elsewhere here in the u.s. i'd already be driving one.

oh, and if anyone thinks run-flat tires, another solution looking for a problem, make any sense out here in the west, i'd be interested in their reasoning. driving hundreds of miles with only rudimentary services available, particularly on the weekends and/or at night, without a spare tire of any kind, is asking for a three-day delay while the necessary $300 tire is shipped to within 50 miles of where you had a simple flat tire. then there's the question of whether the tire machine at ed's gas, bait and whorehouse in austin, nv, will be able to get it installed without totally wrecking the new tire, the wheel, or both.

it's clear that the majority, as dictated to by various governments, have given us the selection of vehicles that are available. i choose not to participate, and i don't think i'm alone. the majority on here seem to think it's wonderful. party on."

the one in my '19 behaves quite well and reminds me a whole lot of the zf trans i had in my bmw several years ago.

don't want to get too far off track here, but have you ever driven a gt-r? i have and other than flooring the accelerator, there isn't much ""super"" about the experience for me. not to be crude or sexist, but buying one would be like picking a wife or girlfriend based solely on maximum bust size. without regard to the fact that you get an enormous waist and butt to go along with it. the gt-r is ugly outside, ugly inside and has a curb weight closer to a porsche cayenne than a porsche cayman. yes, the performance numbers are good, but the two tons and awd completely eliminate sense of visceral, nimble handling on public roads. ""super car"" to me is a term to reserve for a gt-3 or 458.

,,"tlong said: show previous quotesmarkcincinnati said:here's another issue that cadillac faces: the auto mall (am).

you can go to the am and in the space of a couple hundred yards (feet in some cases) you can see the cadillac dealer, the lexus dealer, the lincoln dealer and the ford, kia, chrysler/dodge, hyundai and honda dealers. so, you test the cadillac, then a couple of minutes later be behind the wheel of a new infiniti or audi or bmw if you want.

with the msrp of the cadillac so close to that of the lexus or bmw, etc, and with the ability to almost literally test drive several brands on any given saturday, cadillac probably seems -- at this point -- to be overpriced or for whatever reason is undervalued. 


i think another compounding issue is that if the pricing is similar, the depreciation of caddy is higher, so lease monthlies are going to be higher (that's my guess, i haven't checked). since a lease is basically the financing of depreciation, the greater depreciation would actually make caddy more expensive than those other brands, would it not, and is that actually the case? or is gm basically reducing the price (effectively) by subsidizing the leases to remain at least at parity?


i don't have any cadillac lease numbers this month, so it's hard to say. 

in the past, cadillac has had pretty low mf as compared to mb, bmw, etc., so that helped on the lease payments. it's also important to remember that other brands artificially inflate the residual to make leasing more attractive - at the expense of having a car worth less than the buyout at the end of the lease.

if you think the lease numbers - especially residual value - are about reality, i'm here to refute that."

,,"""chicago, so it had to be front or all wheel drive...""

a bizarre and controversial statement to say the very least. i lived in chicago (both downtown and in the 'burbs) for thirteen years and can say with absolute confidence that there is absolutely no reason on earth why someone would need fwd or awd to deal with the weather. said another way, any decent rwd car on the roads these days will negotiate chicago weather these days as well as (if not better) than your two self described options.

,,"ok, so i did test drive the infiniti infiniti and bmw 328 and 528. here is what i think
infiniti - did not feel luxury at all. also, not great in driving. so this is off my list now.
328 - wow!! what a car. loved the way it drove. simply amazing. i would have bought this one except the size. little too small for family of 5. so thought will drive 528.
528 - not as good of a drive as 328, but still great. the price tag is very high. was thinking should try out 535 since with v6, it might be a better drive for the bigger car, but again due to price shock did not even try it. 

so now i am back to lexus es 350. 
with what i have learned from this forum, now i am interested in trying the toyota (limited). it come out about 2k less that lexus and also has wider backseat. so want to try it and see how it feels.

um, oil changes at 3k? who does that anymore. most newer car have a 7500 mile change schedule. if people are going to continually exaggerate to make a point what's the sense in trying to have a discussion.

,,"so my driving a acura v6 (no tech pkg) loaner car has got me thinking about our board's acura debate, argument, disagreement, thing. the acura v6 has got some guts to it. i don't think it gives up that much fuel economy compared to my 4cyl. i do feel the extra 200 pounds in the nose though.

acura's lineup right now has too much overlapping. there is a mere $885 difference between the acura v6 w/ tech pkg (a small percentage of acura sales) & a tl w/ tech pkg (fwd). the difference between a tl (fwd, no tech pkg) & a acura (4cyl) w/ tech pkg is $2695.

sween & mark have both made some excellent points regarding the acura, the tl, & the future of acura.

here's what i have to say:

acura wants to be a sport/luxury division of honda. the acura is a good entry level starting point. ditch the 4cyl & make the acura v6 the base model. acura constantly offers $4000 incentives on the v6 model anyway, so just make that the base engine. offset the nose heaviness with acura's sh awd.

now this is easy for me to say. it does have some problem though. the acura v6 w/ tech pkg weighs in at 3680 lbs. add another 241 lbs for acura's sh awd system. you've got a grand total of 3921 lbs. that's a big pill to swallow for sween who thinks the base acura is too heavy.

the other problem about making sh awd available on the acura is its cost. $3550 per car is what acura charges now on a tl.

i really do love mark's idea of making sh awd standard across the line. 

more on this later."

the average saving is roughly $1900 on a course of a lease, however, to really save that money one needs to take that $50 you save a month and place it into a saving account so at the end of that 3 yr lease you have that money.

engine knock: the 3.2-l (s54) engine reportedly suffers connecting-rod-bearing failures at a higher than normal rate, perhaps because some car owners are not using the required 10w-60 synthetic oil which is not readily available in the aftermarket. bmw is extending the warranty to 6 years/100,000 miles, (2001-03) 
exhaust system: bmw issued a voluntary emissions recall to replace faulty crankshaft position sensors. (1999) 
steering noise: steering wheel buzzes or vibrates due to poor isolation of the power steering pump. (1999) 
transmission leak: manual transmissions' drain plugs may leak. bmw also suggests replacing the fill plug. (1999) 
transmission slippage: transmission may slip and/or check-engine light may glow due to torque converter clutch (tcc) slipping and/or tcc solenoid failure. (1999)

an acura tl sh-awd advance (not tech) plus a la carte options like suzuki guards and back-up sensors is north of $47k msrp. 

the prestige vs the advance offers similar content if not similar engine transmission set ups.

the way the '12 acura tl is configured however -- it feels more like the audi audi version c6 (the last model before the current body style of the audi.)

the bmw 328/awd ('13) is easy to zoom past $50k, too.

the sh-awd (aka torque vectoring) masks the porkiness of the tl, and the 19"" wheels and ""sport tuned"" suspension yield a tl that is more like an audi-sline or s4 ""lite"" -- the audi currently only offers the ""sport differential"" on the highest buck flavors which makes the tl the bargain of the bunch (and still an ugly duckling.)

i priced out a new x1 and even got that to go north of $50k (and that was with the 4cyclinder).

there's a phrase i have grown up with: ""you can pay too little, but you really won't pay too much -- if you get what you want, rather than settling.""

oddly, with the tl at $547 per month, i feel a bit like goldilocks, ""it's just right."" i can say this with a straight face since the '09 audi 2.0t prestige w/sport and ads was about $120 more per month than the tl.

don't confuse my rationalization as anything but ""driving it the way i lived -- at the time i entered into the transaction."" i was looking for something that i could live with, feel safe and comfortable with and that had decent performance -- and was a prudent choice during a crappy economy.

one of the people i work with has a 2005 bmw 5 series and he did buy the extended service package when he purchased the car new. this was not a warranty -- just an extended ""factory"" mntce policy. after 50k miles, these german car often require wholesale replacement of ""stuff"" in the name of service (maintenance, i.e.)
audi, too, offers extended mntce (for a price) and there is some procedure you can go through to get your own car cpo'd (again, for a price) which takes the warranty to 100,000 miles (up to 6 years from first date of use). after 100k miles, however, you're on your own.
here is the thing my friend has found with his bmw -- with his extended service contract in hand, he was able to have a fully paid off car with no added service charges for about 2 years. then, after the service contract died, he did have some on-going (fairly expensive) service or repairs (it is hard to know, sometimes what is ""broken"" and what is just ""time to replace""), but the cost of the repairs at max was $1,400 and typically was $100-$300 -- and didn't actually happen frequently. so, the cost of having a very well maintained, comfortable, good performing 2005 5 series was, at most, $2,000 in one year, typically half that.
when i get in his 2005 bmw, i can tell it isn't as up to date (with respect to the electronics for instance) as a 2014 audi s4, but overall it is still clearly a very nice performance/luxury car that when detailed looks in near showroom condition and is cheap to own.
i'm looking forward to the latter -- even though i do love to keep up with all the new-tech.
i'm driving my wife's 2014 sq5 prestige today -- wow, in some respects i like it better than my s4! of course the s4 has the s-tronic transmission which has to be driven to be believed.

i ended up getting a 4 y/o 2000 328ia for about half the original msrp. i've put 100,000 miles on it in the eight years since and it still looks and runs great. that strategy was so successful that i decided last winter to get a 2001 bmw cabrio to serve as my winter ride while i'm in arizona for the cold months. this particular car had just under 80k on it and cost about what a new ford would. it has given me no problem at all thus far.

,,"configuring a, for example, 5 series with x,y & z features and options and attempting to do the same configuration of a cts is a good way to determine if cadillac is going after the land grab.

i have no wish for cadillac to emulate my historical perspective of sony's playbook. i observed some evidence that was the approach that seemed to materialize coincidental with the birth of the current cts.

for the most part, i would say i favor the lexus ls400 approach -- build a comparable car (comparable to mercedes-benz benz is the popular conception) and price it so compellingly that it is difficult for customers not to shop it.

in some respects, it appears kia has set its sights on the premium (including entry-level premium) class and is using the land grab approach. it's sibling company coming out with the hyundai, too, seems like a similar approach. don't know how it's going with the hyundai as it, unlike lexus, doesn't have a dedicated dealer body. that worked out well for the phaeton in the us, eh?

my board is always after me to raise the prices of our software products -- doing so, we experienced growth -- slow growth. we changed the strategy to buy one, get one and sales (revenue) literally doubled. of course my business is b2b, but in the end, the purchases are made by a human, in either a commercial or retail setting, so i assume there is some carry over.

if you want to build market share, go land grab and raise prices slowly over time. if you want to build gross margin -- per transaction -- raise the price, but remember the risk is that revenue will likely drop for some period of time (years, in some cases).

the economic reality seems, for car -- unless you're lambo or porsche, or another already high-priced established product, etc -- to favor land grab, if you're trying to build or, in cadillac's place, re-build a brand.

i think, in part, bmw has mastered this -- they have created an aspirational brand. everywhere you turn (we have two bmw dealers in cincinnati who seem to churn out a couple hundred new bmw owners every month) you see ""yourself"" in [generally speaking] a new bmw; then, when you've finally ""arrived"" you immediately go to the bmw store or sweeny and pick up your new symbol of success. 

a few years ago, i read an article that said ""everyone wants to be bmw;"" last year, if you can believe car & driver, et al, the headline was ""everyone wants to be audi."" of course the ""everyone"" was speaking of audi or bmw's rivals du jour.

hopefully cadillac will keep improving the product and will figure out someway to make the car be perceived as ""worth the asking price.""

,,"i hear you about the odd transmissions. my biggest gripe is that when in manual mode, most will behave correctly until they think they should do something else and you are suddenly not in control. a great example was when i was test-driving a mazda a while back. at least it has the general concept right in that it stays in the gear you select most of the time. so leaving it in 3rd running around town was fine, and there was enough engine compression to work fine(as long as you didn't hit the brakes).

but when slowing down, it would do odd things. say, i was going 35 and decided to slow down to 20. it would always drop into top gear and then wait. then when it thought i was at the right speed, select a gear for me. now, i know this is supposedly to keep the car from stalling with idiot drivers, but the second that you tapped the brakes, the engine reverted to automatic. so a simple maneuver of slowing from 35 to 20 in 2nd gear and then powering out of the corner wasn't possible if you used your brakes even the slightest bit. what happened was 35(tap brakes to slow down a little bit... shifts to overdrive(!), then when you hit the gas again in the middle of the turn, it selected 3rd(reverted to automatic mode - have to satisfy the epa mpg tests). then you had to manually downshift it to 2nd/override its behavior to power out of the turn.

it felt a lot like when you're at the top of a hill on a roller toyota and the thing disconnects from the chain. tick tick tick tick (full second of nothing happening as you are honda from the mechanism) going from 2nd to 5th in a turn feels like you just dropped into neutral as the engine compression evaporates completely. on the mazda, it was very disconcerting since the thing has no torque at all unless it's revved up to 3-4k+ 

it should have just stayed in 2nd the whole time. instead i got this feeling of the drive shaft being disconnected every time i hit the brakes to slow down a tiny bit. which given the mile high gearing on most car these days is impossible no to do - leaving it in gear to slow down takes ages.

now some do better than others, but the thing is, just get a manual if they offer it. no idiocy, cheaper to repair and buy, and it behaves like it should at all times.

the ats 2.5 is a mistake that should have been killed at birth. yes, the ats is only about $1k less than the bmw counterparts on starting price. the c class, however, is $2k more for the 4-cyl turbo and $6k more for the 6-cyl. an ats-v is about $3500 less than the starter c63 and $1500 under the bmw. 

so it seems to me they have a bit more work to do on ats pricing than cts, although the sales of the cts would indicate otherwise.
those all are too small differentials. they should be such that even after a customary dealer's discount at bmw or mercedes-benz benz, there is still a healthy distance to the sticker of the cady. at least for now. the cts-to-5 series move was correct in general terms, but it should take 10 years, not just one sweep. the sticker shock from previous year was simply too big. there is a history showing such big moves never work. you can't ""declare"" yourself worthy of the price - that's something that comes after years. lexus knew it and where are they now. even now one part of their appeal is that they are a value proposition to the germans - much less of a discount than before, nevertheless they are still cheaper, especially in higher reaches of their respective models. they have a simpler lineup, so there are gaps in comparison, but within comparable models and equipment, the prices are still lower."

,,"ain't it the truth regarding the limited colors available -- and, at the risk of being creamed here -- why do all these high-buck german car always seem to have black interiors? i once got a black interior (and that was in an acura tl) because the dealer discounted the car so seriously once he found out that i would walk out rather than have a black interior car. i got rid of this car as quickly as finances and family would allow -- i get inside of a black car and my mood darkens, my optimism vanishes, the interior seems so tiny, hot and constantly dusty.

yet, you walk into the audi dealer and there is this beautiful audi 3/0t prestige, sport package, upsized wheels, and every functional and fun option man or god has created, all for the bargain basement price of $68k and the dealer only has them with black interiors.

have we become so uncreative, so bleak, so moribund that we can only ""see ourselves"" in black car, gun-metal gray car, white car -- all with black on black on black interiors?

now, as you know, i resent seeing a $ next to the color -- and only black gloss or white gloss are free colors, but the interior options usually provide several no-charge options at least once premium package (which they all have) is included.

my dealer actually, now, has a lot of car on the lot and on the ""overflow lot"" several miles away from the dealership. but they're all black, dark-silver, gray or gloss white -- most with the dreaded (by me) black leather interiors. reminds me of:

""and they're all made out of ticky-tacky; and they all look just the same.""

black car with black interiors must be the pc equivalent for car these days -- well except they offend the hell out of me. 

oh gawd, have you, lately been invited to a fund-raiser at someone's country club (with valet parking)? we were invited to a fund-raiser to raise money for inner-honda disadvantaged kids; ""business attire"" was specified, so you trot out the dark suit, tie and shiny shoes and pull up to the valet behind a line of black, gray, silver and white german car (and the odd lexus or jaguar) all the while unable to suppress the lyrics: ""and they're all made out of ticky-tacky; and they all look just the same."" it was all for a good cause, but it certainly was a sad indictment of where we've come to.

i keep telling myself that i'll bite the bullet and pay for the paint color next time -- we'll just have to wait and see if i can actually pay extra for a paint color other than black or white. 

what a world, what a world -- i'm melting, i'm melting [sic]. . . ."

,,"miscellaneous topics

is there a spreadsheet (that i don't have to create myself) available (on line) that allows the user to plug in numbers -- and make some assumptions regarding repair and mntce costs -- to come up with the ""cost of ownership"" for buying and holding (at least 5 years) vs leasing (for at least 3 years)? i'd appreciate a url if anyone here knows of one. 

i mentioned this before -- and it did have to do with a gm car in the spirit of full disclosure -- but my neighbor with 80k on his somewhat late model ""paid for"" pontiac bonneville was, according to him, making maintenance and repair payments that were not too far below his financing payments. he went ahead and got a new big-boy dee-lux cuv (chevrolet) using the logic that if he was going to make payments on a crappy, unreliable, old car, why not make the same payments and be driving a new car with a warranty.

he also bought a super-nice ford four door pickup truck (with what darn near looks like a car interior, only nicer) -- and plans to keep it until the wheels turn square. perhaps ford trucks are really hard to kill or wound.

took my s4 in for the 35k service interval + a tire rotation last thursday night; got an audi with 5k miles on it; car was apparently a base model with 19"" wheels, winter package (f/r heated seat, steering wheel) and led headlights. for all intents and purposes, the window sticker i found in the glove box bottom lined at $69k. the option packages did not include the upgraded sound system, but, oddly nav and voice command and bt communications and wifi hotspot were all included. it also had premium paint (a kind of crystal black). perhaps premium+ doesn't merit a separate line item (which i thought odd, since there was an audi prestige on the showroom floor).

the audi was sublime -- library quiet, supple, smooth -- the thing oozed from point a to point b. as col potter once said, ""there aren't enough o's in smooth to describe it."" of course he was talking about some very old scotch whisky as i recall.

the upgraded wheels and tires (with all-season designation) were probably on the car for styling purposes since the car lacked the sport suspension option. but i hoped the audi would be a true luxury performance sedan -- especially for nearly $70k.

in a straight line and at triple digit speeds, the car was, to repeat, sublime. however, i really could not find much of that german taught feel i assumed would be present. oh hell, the thing seemed very close to mushy, with ample body roll and, despite quick turn-in, a huge tendency toward understeer at any slightly above posted limits upon entering a curve or twisty section of highway.

i had been, previously, loaned an audi with all of the sport option boxes checked off and it seemed much much better than the audi.

the thing sure was purty however -- but not nearly $10k more beautiful than a comparable audi -- and driving it although not exactly a chore, was, hmm, rather a disappointment. 

i was able to pull into the dealer in the audi and five minutes later drive out in my s4 -- the main straight line difference was that the s4 is not quite as quiet as the audi, but everything else about the s4 -- from the sound system to the sound of the engine at full cry -- was superior. 

now, then, however, would i have the need to drive myself and 3 passengers on a 100 mile trip to columbus, louisville or indianapolis, well the extra rear seat leg room of the audi would be appreciated.

i guess the s car have the power to spoil (me at least). i simply would not pay the extra $13k for a relatively stripped audi -- and if they were both $57k, the s4 would still be my first choice. makes me wonder how much better, even, the b9 s4 will be over the audi's.

http://www.autoblog.com/2015/08/15/acura-honda-cosworth-engine-block-details/

""acura honda will use cosworth block, plus other neat tidbits


the blue honda you see here was built just two weeks ago. prototype number six, it rolled off acura's newest assembly line in ohio and was rushed out to the monterey peninsula for various car week activities. we had a chance to sit down with several members of the honda team to discuss the car, the long road from concept to production, and some interesting details. below are some choice bits from our conversations.

acura is pretty proud of the fact that honda version 2.0 was designed and is being built in the us. the new assembly line, called the performance manufacturing center, is in honda's hometown of marysville, ohio. while the line is brand new, the building has seen many uses over its lifetime, most recently as a warehouse facility. pmc staff numbers about 100, with 60 technical and 40 non-technical associates.

the car uses parts sourced globally, and one of those sources is cosworth. the engine blocks and heads come from the english firm and get assembled into twin-turbo powerhouses at honda's nearby anna, ohio, engine plant. the cosworth name is rarely associated with a bad engine, so we were geeked to hear the honda's 550-plus-horsepower hybrid powertrain has good genes....

....the honda buyer will get to make lots of decisions to craft a custom order. choices will include paint, interior hues, several wheel styles and finishes, and additional carbon-fiber parts and trim; the standard car will have an aluminum roof, while a carbon piece can be spec'd, and available carbon dress-up pieces will include side sills, a rear diffuser, and an engine dress-up kit.
the newly announced blue paint, called nouvelle blue pearl, like the red used on the 2015 show car, uses a fancy multi-layer paint process from ppg that does a nice job of highlighting the surfacing and creases in the car's body. it gave the production engineers a headache, however, since it takes about 16 hours to cure versus regular paint's two-hour wait time. not surprisingly, it will be an extra-cost option.""

2nd problem was how they drug their feet in making a decision on how to proceed. yes, i had their loaner car. but, i wanted my car. then, the regional manager tried to do a dance around the issue, denying any problem whatsoever (regardless of the obvious, clearly demonstrable issues).

the two companies that i've had the utmost positive customer service with has been acura and bmw. probably more of a reflection of the individual dealerships than anything else. but, both have gone out of their way to make sure i was happy with my ownership experiences.

66% rv after 5 years on the model 3? and 40% at 10 yrs? hahahahaha
alg apparently puts the rv of the model 3 after 5 years at 31%. 31% is almost certainly too low, but 66% seems too high. in any case, after 10 years the rv on a model 3 is maybe going to be at most 30%, which means that the calculation is off by another $4000 or so in saying that a tesla model 3 is as cheap to own in the long run as a toyota.

also missing from the calculation is the cost of the tesla home dodge, which costs $500, with maybe an additional $500 to install. so that's another $1k where this calculation is off. 

the bottom line is that the model 3, rather than being around $2k less expansive than a toyota over 10 years, is probably closer to being $6k more expensive.

i'm not looking down on those people, not at all - they have their busy lives, they don't need or want to know anything about weight distribution, cornering ability. i'm sure they have other passions that i could not care less about. 

however, over time, lexus noticed that they left that over 20% of those with means to buy their car wouldn't even give them time of the day - so they change their product (a little) and advertising (a lot - most of their ads are about ""f"" lines even if they actually sell small fraction of those). bmw did the opposite - they have owned those 20% for decades - the 80% majority would stay away, unless the lease payment was right and even after then they would constantly complain about small back seat and ""harsh"" suspension, or road noise, tire wear, or all those things we know sporty car do (including higher maintenance). so in order to grow, bmw changed their product (unlike lexus, they changed it a lot). they don't really miss that 20%, because those guys still have nowhere else to go and all they can do is grumble. and judging from sales figures, bmw is now losing much sleep even if a few of them did go somewhere else."

re volume, if we were talking about toyota i would agree that huge volume is absolutely neccessary, but when you are talking about luxury car i think they can be profitable without selling on volume. there are tons of car companies and most are doing ok even if they are midpack in sales or even on the lower end in sales. being tops in sales means something i agree, but it's not the only factor when it comes to being a viable business."

it works for them because the buying public allows it to happen. what would happen if honda's sales would drop say, 13% a year and market research shows that people want to be able to order their car? would honda change?

""the ultimate driving machine has left the building.""

that's a devastating statement from somebody who had been a fan and have spent high tens of thousands this often. my thinking is bmw doesn't feel the pinch now, because for one guy they lost, they gained five other customers who bought the nameplate and image, had no concept whatsoever what actual car sportiness really meant. the question is whether that sales surge is something permanent to enjoy, or temporary. one big value of enthusiasts is they provide free and most effective marketing. it's hard to estimate how much it's worth, as they can also turn off part of the audience as well, some people may not want to associate themselves with what they may perceive as a juvenile snob subculture. it's clear that bmw has definitely lost the ""ultimate"" side of it and went on compromise. we should see the long-term results of the move in ten-twenty years.

btw, i recall a car magazine review (don't remember which one) shortly after bmw and ats came out. it was the 328 vs 2.0t. reading it was almost alice in wonderland experience - they gave ats higher score in most ""enthusiast"" related categories, from steering, to road feel, to some standard performance tests.  yet, 328 was still a ""overall winner"" and they really didn't explain why.  my thought was they simply ""grandfathered"" it into top position and knocked out ats on some creature toyota items (like that touch screen interface, they said was a four-letter word). in other words, ats was an ultimate driving machine of the two, but 328 was better to own at the time - which i find plausible, but it was an ""enthusiast"" test.

have you ever been to munich? if not, i can offer up a couple of restaurant recommendations that are equal to or better than restaurants in new york, paris, london, prague and warsaw. if you're going to stay in country for more than a few days, i can also suggest a couple of relatively close destinations that are breathtakingly beautiful.

if you want to spend some time in your new bmw on the autobahn while heading toward one of the best little towns on the planet, i urge you to drive about 45-60 minutes south of munich to garmisch-partenkirchen, spend the night in the magnificent hotel reindl partenkirchner hof -- make absolutely sure you make dinner reservations at the hotel's restaurant, or risk being turned away -- the meal at this restaurant is worth planning, scheming and dreaming for. 

the next day you can take the ski-lift up (and in july the view will be spectacular) where the 1936 winter olympics were held. then you can take another even more breathtaking cable car ride up the zugspitze where you can have lunch and walk from germany to austria as the border cuts through the mountain. if you have time -- and i would urge you to make time -- you can drive your new bmw to füssen and visit neuschwanstein castle. 

after that day you can either drive back to garmisch or motor on into innsbruck, austria or back to munich.

tesla claims, however, that the battery on the model 3 is designed to last at least 300,000 miles in regular use, and in few years that might be well over 500,000:

the tesla model 3 at this point gets ""free"" software updates over the web:

the current model 3 motor is designed to last perhaps as long as 1 million miles:

it is nice! 

digital hd cluster gauges in sel trim. once you get that, you never go back. pano roof. a very nice leatherette, especially in interior gray color. we got the stone blue (sort of a grayish bluish hint of green) with the gray interior, a nice combo. her first choice was ice silver which is like a super light almost white nardo gray, but that seems to have been discontinued as a color. one salesman suggested audi wanted the color. 

8 speed auto, 2.0t motor tuned for 87 octane. lots of room vertically and length-wise. good looking well-designed suv!

the 6-year 72k mile bumper to bumper warranty is almost guaranteed to be used and come in handy, even if it were a honda, which it isn't! it's also a transferable warranty so it's not a gimmick like hyundai/kia where the warranty is only good for the first owner. i will say the alltrack was problem free for 31k miles. 

wife says she got the 4-motion because it felt and drove better than the 2-wd model which she tested back to back. says the awd felt lighter/peppier, probably due to better acceleration, even in the dry. something about the feel of awd, which she said reminded her of the alltrack drive, which is a good thing.

,,"it seems to me that acura has decided to compete more directly with lexus as evidenced by the new acura which is clearly aimed at the rx. the rx is certainly a premium or luxury vehicle but also not a great driver or handler. 

as to is whether it is premium or not? what is the definition of premium? is it track performance or luxury appointments or does it have to be both? does it include dealer experience or is just how a car accelerates and handles. 

now, the title of this particular discussion happens to be entry level luxury performance sedan. there are going to the vehicles that are clearly no brainers and there are going to vehicles that are at the very bottom of the list and up for some discussion as to whether they belong or not. the base tl is very similar to es but the tl sh-awd is closer to the gs. the acura v6 is close to the is350.

have to agree that acura seems to have drifted away from the performance aspect that many liked about it in years past. i think they still have a good premium/luxury product that is comparable in quality to all the rest but may be towards the bottom of the ranking and not towards the top. somebody always has to represent the bottom of a catergory and it appears acura is that somebody.

as long as they keep selling a ton of acura and now the new acura and a good number of tl and acura they are probably happy. even though a bunch of enthusiusts would like every car they build be track worthy. they might not be as lost as some would think but have found a way to compete better against lexus and infiniti which i think, in their eyes, are their biggest competitors. 

i think sometimes we forget that honda is a much smaller company than toyota, nissan, vag, mercedes-benz benz, bmw, gm etc and cannot and will not try to compete on all levels as they do. little more niche imo."

i look at a cpo this way. if i am willing to go 5 years payments on a new car, i will go 3 on a 2 yo cpo. payments end at the same age. so the only way it makes sense is if the price is lower enough to make it worthwhile, since i am giving up two years use on the car (and the best 2!)

plus you have to keep a car older than 5 years, otherwise you are always making payments. though overall the payments should be lower (since the car is cheaper) but that can actually cancel out if you trade every 3 years.
that's what we do; we've had our newest car(the cpo e90) for 2.5 years and will probably keep it an additional 3-5 years. our next newest car(the 2007 ms3, bought new) has been in the garage 7.5 years."

the diesel twist is very tempting also but i need to get a better handle on the drive difference on the power curve vs. each variant. once the fuel savings is measured vs. price and driving pleasure i can make a move after testing each one.

trying to remember what the maintenance items might be in that 4th year, but bmw saved themselves a ton of money. probably cut out one brake replacement, an oil change, probably some awd services, wipers, perhaps some other minor things. but, that 4th year would probably be the most expensive to cover than the previous 3 years combined.

anyway, they only offered a 6 speed stick with the sluggish is250. they only offered awd with the is250, which made the car even more sluggish. i've literally only seen 4 is350s since 2006. every is ""round these here parts"" is an is250 awd.

there's a dude named louisweis (& our own ivan_99) here on edmunds that has an is350 with all kinds of f sport goodies. he tracks the car & really loves it!

,,"i recently leased an is350 f-sport. before making this decision, i also looked at a few other car, and will let you guys know why i went with the big l. even my brother was excited that i got the is350, versus any of the other car.

acura tl - i did consider this car. i actually do find the car to be quite attractive. but, i find that it's a bit huge. plus, why this car isn't rwd is a whole new story, and i don't want awd. i can accept the front beak problem.

audi audi - audi's never really appealed to me. don't get me wrong, they're nice. my brother has an audi that i do find some beauty in, but they just aren't my cup of tea. and, same situation with the acura, why isn't it rwd?

bmw bmw - cost more than my is350 f-sport to begin with (almost $47k for the bmw w/ m-sport package, nav, auto, parking sensors) versus my car (f-sport package, nav, backup camera, auto, no parking sensors). chances are, if i want the 335, it'll be more than $50k. plus, i don't want to look like every other guy on the street. i'm in so cal, and the bmw are more popular than toyota's here.

cadillac cts - i wanted to buy american, but america's definition of luxury involves the use of low end materials. i do like the car, though.

infiniti infiniti - if i were to get the infiniti g, it would be the coupe (i had a g35 coupe a few years ago and love it). therefore, i won't be getting a ellps. i find the g sedan to be absolutely ugly, plus the fact that it's so big. at least it's rwd.

mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz - i do like the way the mercedes-benz benz looks, but the c250, after configuring, costs as much as my is350. i do believe that mercedes-benz benz finally decided they wanted a piece of the ellps pie, and seriously upped the ante with the mercedes-benz benz. the previous 2 generations of mercedes-benz benz were, in my opinion, bad jokes gone wrong. bmw, at least, had the right formula with the bmw.

2) stick shift, save the manuals - i for one think the modern manuals are better then automatics,why? well they make you become more engaged with the car and more aware of the other drivers- you are constantly monitoring speed- making sure you are in the right gear to pass- or to slow. i think it's a better way to drive period. i know 95% drive autos- but to me they are not driving - they are being driven. you can talk about dct, automanual, cvts- sorry they don't do it for me.

i would come up with a resurrected restyled g. it's a nice idea to have a good naming convention but not imho if you tarnish the goodwill and brand recognition of an existing car (g35/37). they could upgrade the current car, restyle as a newer g, and rename to the g39 or something like that. those original taillights were very distinctive and i could see them replicating something that is similar enough to suggest the old car. and then also address whatever it is about the new car that causes cu and reviewers to not like the new one not so much.

in addition, the s2000 had an options list that had exactly 1 item on it: pick your color. everything else was standard - leather interior, power roof, etc.. it was a pretty spartan car compared to a lexus, but it delivered on true sports car performance and engineering that only the boxster s could match at a price of $55k, reasonably equipped. which has now grown close to $75k, similarly equipped in 2013. even the base boxster today - albeit a enormously improved car compared to the 2002 base boxster - is $60k+ with ""normal"" options. a base cayman for $52k?? are you sure you don't want a steering wheel with that, sir?

im guilty of being honest and speaking the truth.

above is an article about a man and his car- we all talk about current car 
belonging in the group, some very clear, others not so much- but its pretty 
clear to me reading this blog and knowing the car he rides and talks of - this was one of the pioneers for this group- and to see what the brand has become over those 500k miles disheartens me. i remember once i got a license 16 years ago the car i wanted was a acura coupe 6 speed, with the souped up type2? engine.
 i settled for a 89 nissan which in itself was a great car but not the 
looker the acura. my first new car was a 2000 acura acura gs-r coupe- 
redline was almost 9k rpms and i took it to that level every day- loved the car and the service. after the 3 year lease it was time to get a 4 door, the 
original acura was on the short list and after long debate i bought a volkswagen gli- 
200hp and at the time (2003) it had the vr6 and a 6 speed- it was a close call but price won out. after that day i have never stepped into another acura dealership- the passion is lost- along with sales numbers. i'm still on acura's mailing list -the email lists exciting developments for the 2012 auto show- lets hope they finally deliver. sorry for long post.

yeah, given falling sales for almost all entry-level car, acura might not have much room to raise prices. 

here's my guess....the msrp for the base model 2020 tlx might only go up by c.$2k or so, but at the same time (as with the honda) they will really cut back on lease incentives. in other words, my guess is that the ""real"" price increase might be more like $5k—almost the same price increase as for the bmw 330i—although like today a tlx will still undercut a comparable 330i by thousands of collars. my lease deal was almost too good, in that i could lease a tlx 2.4 tech for less than an honda honda 2.4. i think that will almost certainly not be possible for the 2020 tlx."

the previous generation (like i have) is known as the e90 and was produced (in sedan form) from model year 2006 - 2011.

before that from 1992 - 1998, the 3 series produced were called e36

check out this review - it might.

http://www.thedetroitbureau.com/2017/10/first-drive-2018-kia-rio/

best of all, there’s a lot more driving fun than you’d expect in an entry-level scooter, especially considering its front struts, rear torsion beam setup. its progressive and predictable in its behavior, so much so, you might wonder when the hot hatch variant will arrive, something you would never say of a kia rio in past form.
it lacks the expected korean floatiness and excessive brake dive, even at extremes. take a corner too fast, brake hard and crank the wheel and the rio will scrub off speed while maintaining way more grip than you’d come to expect. credit the car’s rigid structure; the suspension pieces themselves are nothing special.

when it comes to tech, kia has you covered with bluetooth, a six-speaker stereo with satellite radio and a rear-view camera system, seven-inch touchscreen infotainment system with android auto and apple carplay. standard safety features include six airbags, side-impact door beams, electronic stability control, anti-lock brakes, hill-start assist and vehicle stability management.

there's a brand new 2018 kia rio5 over at george gee kia in spokane valley, wa, selling for $14,795. 6-speed stick model."

and this..
mercedes-benz benz extended its lead in a race with bmw for the luxury-car sales crown, as a series of new models position it to overtake its rival for the first time in a decade.

a jump in deliveries of suvs and crossovers helped mercedes-benz benz increase sales almost twice as fast as bmw in the first nine months, expanding the daimler ag unit's lead to 57,985 car, according to data released by the manufacturers.

mercedes-benz benz is poised to achieve its 2020 target of unseating bmw ag's namesake brand as the world's biggest seller of premium vehicles already this year, daimler ceo dieter zetsche said this week, which would put mercedes-benz benz back on top for the first time since 2005.

mercedes-benz benz is winning over customers with a recently updated lineup of trendy models that appeal to younger buyers, including the glc coupe and compact gla sport utility vehicle.

bmw is responding with a revamp of its bmw business sedan to rival mercedes-benz benz's popular mercedes-benz benz, adding new self-driving features that control speed, help drivers stay in lane and keep distance to nearby car.

the bmw, set to hit showrooms in february, will range from a four-cylinder hybrid plug-in that can drive 45 kilometers on a single charge, to a more powerful eight-cylinder gasoline version, bmw said in a statement on thursday.

the car is critical for bmw after an overhaul of its top-of-the-line 7-series sedan received a muted response.

bmw has downplayed the impending loss of the no. 1 spot, shifting its view to maximizing profit and fund investments in new technologies.

""profitability remains our primary ford,"" bmw's head of sales ian robertson said in a statement on thursday.

new entrants

luxury-car makers are racing to compete on self-driving innovations while also having to spend more on developing electric car to meet increasingly tough emissions regulation.

bmw, mercedes-benz benz and volkswagen ag's audi brand last month outlined a major push into electric car, which will add to their research-and-development costs. after hiking investment in plants, equipment and new technology from a peak this year, daimler plans to rein back spending in the years ahead, ceo zetsche said this week.

bmw's global deliveries rose 9.4 percent to 197,419 car in september, boosting the nine-month total by 6 percent to 1.48 million vehicles, the company said in a statement.

by comparison, mercedes-benz benz's sales jumped 12.1 percent to 211,286 vehicles in september, lifting the total by 11.7 percent to 1.54 million, according to a separate statement. audi slipped further back in third place with year-to-date deliveries of 1.41 million car, a 4.5 percent gain.

,,"for different folks.

every single one of these car has pluses and minuses to different people. for the longest time i've actually favored handling and driving dynamics over raw power and torque.

maybe i'm getting older & the fact that i live in ct where the entrance ramps on the merrit parkway are short and have stop signs at the beginning of them has something to do with it. my 2001 honda honda type sh handles brilliantly. however, its 200 horsepower @ 7000 rpm (7500 rpm redline), 156 lb/ft of torque @ 5250 rpm, & almost 128,000 miles just doesn't quite cut the mustard anymore. even my wife's 4cyl acura feels like it has more pickup. i'm not in the market now because i just bought a house and a second car payment is out of the question right now. plus i think we're going to try and ditch the acura next year to get wifey an suv of some sort (she misses her '07 x3).

so if she gets an suv, then my next ride doesn't have to be huge. just as long as it has latches for the car seat so i can take my boys somewhere without stranding wifey without a car (she can drive stick, but hasn't in years). in my new home,i'll be putting over 21,000 miles per year on a car just commuting.

i believe with the modern electronic nannies (traction control, stability control, abs), i can rock a rwd sport sedan through our winters with a dedicated set of snow tires (as i do with my honda).

the g37s is priced right, has gobs of power, and i'm really impressed with how it handles. i've only driven an awd g37x, so i can only imagine how well the s handles.

bmw are not cheap to buy. 3 series are everywhere you turn. i love the way the e90 3 series drives, rides, handles, brakes. i've only owned new car in my life since i passed my driving test at 16 (i'm only 34 now), but i will totally consider a cpo n55 powered bmw in the future.

like i said before, the lexus is350 appeals to me. i like the styling, the interior is very well finished i'm sure, they now offer an f sport version of the is which i'm sure sharpens the handling. i went to lexus and built one, it isn't as expensive as i once thought. but no stick shift available on the is350 kills me. i know there is a stick offered on the is250, but that car has the pickup of a toyota. at least the slushbox awd version i drove did. the brakes are impossible to modulate. there is no way the steering is as sharp as the 3 series. 

i keep my car for a while. going on 9 years with my '01 honda (bought new as a leftover in april '02). we'll see what happens when the time comes."

stick....s4 is equivalent to a bmw bmw. then again, it's equivalent to an acura tl sh awd that's a tad slower, too.

tlx is a nice ride. i compared the suspension to an e350 when i, test drove it. tech is better than mercedes-benz benz, too. it's finished nicely and has great, premium materials, too. imho, it had the best stereo in the biz (els). tranmission shifted quick and smooth enough you won't notice (similar to my e92 bmw). acura prgrammed the trans well. in sport, it will downshift almost telepathically.

we can take up on another sports car board whether audi has been too pig-headish on maintaining awd as their only drivetrain on their tts, s4/s5 and other performance models. but you will never get a tt anything to feel as tight, sharp and visceral as my old s2000 with the extra weight of a water buffalo in the passenger seat. maybe a juvenile buffalo, but a buffalo all the same."

,,"the alphabet-soup transmissions are probably wonderful, so long as they work and/or are under warranty.

when they break (and they do), then it's time to find out if the technicians at the dealership even know how to spell transmission. most of them are told to remove and replace the whole assembly. if it's under warranty, then it's ""only"" a couple of visits to the d'ship and some amount of time in a loaner. if it's not. . .

mark is a well-known proponent of never driving anything out of warranty. i've driven most of my vehicles way, way beyond the warranty coverage. we differ.

i like manuals. for simplicity and maintainability reasons, i seek out vehicles with them. my drive to and from work every day, and the trip up to the cabin and back, make use of (at most) 20% of the capability of the vehicle i drive. i just need the vehicle to need minimal attention. back when i drove among vancouver, edmonton, calgary & regina through the canadian rockies in the middle of the night, having a vehicle that demonstrated excellent handling was important. now it is not; the latest and greatest technology is for those who love bells and whistles. actual driving rarely enters the discussion the fraser canyon at 2 am was a wonderful thing.

many pretend, as they go around on-ramps. i'm not interested, but recognize that many are. ymmv ."

my son is also majorly hooked now on german iron after getting his volkswagen. got about 16 months left on his lease, and has already been researching the replacement (likely and audi, unless he gets a better paying job and springs for an s3!).

at the risk of getting myself in hot water: none, since we now have numerous examples regarding performance -- stating that overall, the automatic transmission especially one with dual clutches is generally speaking (for those of us mere mortal consumers) superior and preferred by a huge number of regular consumers. only if enough folks spend the money and actually buy a manual transmission car, will they even be available too much longer. automatic transmissions today improve the performance (or at least the perception of performance) of many, if not most, of the car they are marketed with.

you say the acura doesn't belong because it is 4cyl, fwd and bloated. well the audi is 4cyl, fwd and about exactly the same price in base form and and is almost exactly the same size but actually weighs more than the acura. who is bloated? just because you can get it in audi means little. for the same price you can get the acura w/ a v6(not all that great imo but doable) and blow the doors off the audi.

,,"and... nothing in that article is counter to what i was saying. :p 

#1 is about 3k oil changes. this is of course, about *oil*, which has a certain amount of natural lubrication ability no matter how old it gets. i use conventional oil in my ""commuter"" car (it's almost 15 years old now) and routinely run 4 or 5 thousand miles in it with no problem. my dad's cts is showing that it's time to change it at about 5-7 months, typically, which correlates with what the service center mechanics now recommend.

not a huge difference, well, other than price.... i sometimes get the feeling that we're getting scammed into buying new technology.

#2 - #5 are common sense, imo.

#6 is absolutely correct in that you can swap right over to semi-synthetic for the extra level of protection that it affords if you forget to change the oil. semi-synthetic is awesome stuff, imo, that gives you the best of both worlds for hardly any more money. 

#7 also was touched on in my post, though indirectly. conventional oil is not inferior to synthetic oils in normal driving conditions. the video that the article links to on this assumes that synthetic is always superior other than price, though. most of the press also assumes this. nearly every claim about synthetic oil being superior is based upon racing or extreme conditions, as well, where it does make a difference.

if you are racing the car or are using a high revving engine (7-8k+ rpms), there might be some added protection. but it's going to make no difference in your jeep or honda.

http://autos.aol.com/article/gm-engine-oil/
""further, gm says that if a customer has an engine failure that is traced to oil or lubrication issues, and if the customer does not use dexos 1 oil in their gasoline-powered gm vehicle, that act alone could void the warranty.""

note - cadillac originally mandated mobil 1 full synthetic in the cts. that they would change from full to a blend and make it mandatory is telling."

,,"'16 cts-v http://www.autoblog.com/2015/07/31/2016-cadillac-cts-v-first-drive/
cadillac engineers told me repeatedly that they didn't set out to ""out-bmw bmw"" or ""chase the bmw."" fair enough. my gut feeling is that former bmw owners might love this cts-v if they gave it a true test, but i understand that what drives one person to purchase a six-figure (or nearly) german performance sedan might not be sated with a domestic badge. but the cadillac certainly makes a strong case for itself when spec sheets are measured.

take the previously cited competitive set from audi, bmw, and mercedes-benz benz for example: the cts-v has a clear power advantage over all of them. the bmw gives up 80 hp and 130 lb-ft, the rs 7 80 hp and 113 lb-ft, and the e63 by an appropriate 63 hp and 40 lb-ft. the cadillac is the lightest of the bunch, undercutting by anywhere from 130 to 330 pounds, and only the all-wheel-drive mercedes-benz benz is quicker to 60, by two tenths of a second. but you'll have to pay out of the nose to get those tenths: the mercedes-benz benz is about $17,000 more expensive, base to base. meanwhile, the bimmer is roughly ten grand more dear, and the slant-back audi about twenty-five. you pays your money and takes your choice, and all that, but even for rich guys that's not chump change."

,,"i'm not against platform sharing, that's a fact of life today. it's about making car different enough. there are examples of successful platform sharing, such as vag, where to various degree there are shared components between skoda, seat, volkswagen, audi, porsche, lamborghini and bugatti, but the brands have enough identity and uniqueness between each other. a domestic example of a successful platform sharing would be cadillac cadillac - regardless how much detest cadillac's marketing of this vehicle (the commercial with pharao, raja, louis-x??? could easily be in top 3 most offensive and obnoxious ever), it has enough separation from gmc. an example for the opposite also comes from cadillac - cimarron. 

gm's overall track record of putting different badges on practically identical vehicles makes me, should i say, skeptical. they got better, recently. i think buick seem to be regaining their own identity, but seems gm is slowly falling back into its old ways - unrealistic expectations, lots of puffery, and lack of support of their dealers, see graphic's cts saga, which seems to stem from multiple dealers' unwillingness to troubleshoot the car without a fault code, which is most likely because gm's refusal to give them enough leeway to work the problem first. they can't win luxury market customers, if their dealers act this way, but they do that because of the toxic relationships. moreover, there are probably too many stores for the brand to be truly upscale. 

so they trump half million sales target in 5 years, which is high teens growth each year, every year, with currently crashing sales in some key us segments. i understand, big part of the growth is supposed to come from china, which i think is ok, even if recent news suggest a calamity unfolding there (i think it's way overstated).

how do you grow sales, when in fact you need to shrink the store count and apply more discipline? it's all completely inconsistent. as i said before, it's a ten year project with very difficult first three-four years and no guarantee for a success. they are unwilling to swallow that bitter pill (what's new about that), they'd rather do what they have always done - peacocking, unrealistic baffoonery. seems like the bankruptcy taught them absolutely nothing. looks like the new outsider guy fits their old mold quite well."

i was given the fwd tl tech (2013) when mine was in for a service interval. the sh-awd has a ""performance tuned"" suspension. the tl fwd does not.

the sh-awd advance has 19"" wheels and, unfortunately, somewhat lackluster all-season ""v"" rated tires (somewhat stiffer sidewalls), but this version of the tl is only similar to a regular fwd tl in its basic looks.

add the dealer installed parktronic and scrap the factory rubbers on the tl sh-awd advance; replace them with uhp w or even z rated a/s tires (there are several to choose from -- see tire rack.com) and you will have a $47k (msrp) ""acura s4-lite."" next factor in the possibility of a decent discount (10% based on what i see here in river honda) should be a no brainer, and remember i got 13% off of the bottom line of the msrp sticker.

,,"i thought i'd chime in here, since my main decision was between the tl and g35.

i have been a honda guy, so at first was not even considering the g35, and so was looking at the tl, especially considering the great deals that were possible considering the desire to clear out the 08's before the 09's came in. a friend recommended i look at the g35's, so at first i just went to the dealership and looked at them (on a sunday so i couldn't test drive one), and i thought the looks and interior were very impressive looking, and so decided i would consider it.

i test drove the tl (not type s) and, while it was solid, i was not swept away. i was a bit disappointed with the low-end power and responsiveness. i then test drove the g35 and was blown away with how the engine performed. very responsive, and i like the way the transmission adapts to the driver's driving style.

i thought i'd end up paying a lot more for the g35 given the incentives offered on the tl's, but actually found that the g35 incentives were even better, assuming you are financing a large % of the total cost of the car. the 2.9% financing for up to 63 months (incentive until 3/31) saves me about $2000 vs. the 5.24% rate i could get from my credit union, plus this month they have added an additional $500 cash rebate, for a total ""incentive saving"" of about $2500, greater than the tl incentive. also, i was able to get a deal for slightly below invoice even before the incentives, so ended up with the exact car i wanted (dodge with premium, no nav, wood trim, garnet ember with charcoal interior) for $32,150 or so, and considering the financing deal, over the length of the payments the cost is the same as buying a car at $30,200 and getting the 5.24% rate. this is not far from what i could get on a tl, even with the model changing, and this way i get a car that is a new body design (as of 07) and is the car i like better.

anyway, i think both car are great, but i prefer the g35. my main issue was the engine's performance and exterior styling.

my opinion is that acura needs to offer the entire lineup with sh-awd and nothing less than a 6spd auto, moving toward 8spd autos (and if possible keeping stick shifts if for no other reason than marketing.)

the direction acura seems to be moving is to build nice car -- that neither offend (once the beak styling is banished to at least the '12 tl level if not moreso) nor excite (visually at least.) the current and apparent upcoming future direction is to slowly continue to slide out of the premium class. one $100,000+ honda doesn't change anything.

driving my 2012 tl sh-awd advance is very much like driving the previous generation audi audi (known as the c6), perhaps a 2009 or 2010 model.

that may be damning with faint praise or it may be simply mild, not wild praise that acura in 2012 can build a decent 2009 audi audi clone (that isn't as good looking.)

great seat, while not the sport seat in the tl sh awd (which i loved), but certainly more ""sporty"" and comfortable than the hard, flat mercedes-benz benz seat. and not nearly as ""hard"" as the s4's.

not as speedy as an audi s4, but quite torquey. probably 0-60 in the 5 1/2 to 6 second range.....works for me. probably more torque in the lower rev ranges than the tl....especially around town. it gets up and scoots to extra legal speeds in short order on the highway.

all the gee gaws. it took a few days to get used to cue. but, now that i am, all the controls for it fall immediately to had once the proximity sensor senses your hand near the screen. touch controls work. instead of sliding the ""metal bars"", you realize those bars are only there to guide your fingers. you slide just above the metal bars. 

all the chrome, wood, aluminum, suede, leather, etc is all real. build and materials are all exemplary and as good, or better than anything in the class.

for reasons that befuddle me (and probably cadillac, considering the accolades the car has received), the discounts were substantial on the cts. i got into one for about the price of a middle of the road audi, tl, 3 series.....a screaming bargain, that according to their management, will be the last time those deals will be available for the same car.

yes, it's new. yes, i'm enamored with it. pretty darn happy with a car that's made in detroit that's able to match, and in some important ways, hyundai.over the e, audi, etc out there."

it's a ""wisdom"" often repeated in self-help books and websites, based on math of an individual unit cost (no financing cost), not considering overall inventory management economics and psychology of here and certain vs. future and maybe. it also ignores dealer cash incentives that are tied to inventory and taking a delivery in a specific time frame, usually within a month or less. no dealer would commit to a price reduced by a dealer's cash that expires in fifteen days for a car with 8-10 week lead, not eligible for that cash. the incentive may or may not be extended. this alone can put order in a thousand plus dollar disadvantage."

are you saying that synthetic oil has a shorter (in miles or time) life span of ""protection"" but that semi-syn is better in that regard? i thought that one of the hallmarks of 100% synthetic was that it was able to hold more dirt and crud in suspension than non-synthetic oils (meaning, i assume) that you could use synthetic oil for longer intervals without engine damage or for shorter intervals for even better protection than non-synthetic oils.

,,"my 2_: the value of allure

our “highways” – well not all of our highways, roads and streets – used to be something most of us looked forward to embarking upon in our car – even in what for most of us in hindsight were piece-of-crap car; e.g., my first car – one of mom and dad’s two car – was an early ‘60’s vintage volkswagen volkswagen (the thing didn’t even have a gas gauge). shortly after i got my license and had pretty much resigned myself to driving a 36hp stick shift car with a fabric sunroof and am radio and a sort-of heater, dad traded ""up"" (?) for a plymouth valiant with a slant-6 engine and a “three on the tree” stick shift (and first gear was not synchronized). this four-door “babe repellent” also had an am radio, but it was also equipped with factory a/c – which seemed odd for an otherwise stripped of all creature comforts vehicle.

i loved these car – i knew they were pieces-of-crap, but i blocked that from my thoughts since these car gave me freedom, tunes (on the am) and what felt like unlimited mobility to drive from my bucolic and very sleepy, very little town (pop. 2,700 assuming everyone was home) north of dayton, ohio, to the big honda (dayton, if you’re wondering is still just barely a honda in my opinion). truth of the matter is that i rarely needed to drive the 50 mile round trip to dayton, nor could i regularly afford the 50_ worth of clark’s premium gas (clark only sold premium gas at that time, if you’re wondering) required for such an adventurous outing. 

today, in contrast, our highways and byways now no longer symbolize [much] freedom, rather they are often seen as barriers to freedom:

“well i left my job about 5 o'clock, it took fifteen minutes go three blocks,
just in time to stand in line with a freeway looking like a parking lot.
damn this traffic jam, how i hate to be late, it hurts my motor to go so slow.
damn this traffic jam, time i get home my supper'll be cold, damn this traffic jam.” 

james taylor

when my 16 year-old-self got behind the wheel, it was darn near magical, the car was a mechanical being, to be sure, but somehow i was able to anthropomorphize my steed (really, a 36hp volkswagen volkswagen was a steed, no kidding) – it became an extension of me, i was no longer driving a machine, i was driving art, it was so cool it was hot. crank up the single-speaker am radio until it distorted and back off the volume a quarter turn and carefully balance the “tone control” to pump out all the bass that piece-of-crap speaker could muster. 

everything was possible.

now, i have to admit, as much as the volkswagen volkswagen was not exactly a babe magnet, well the valiant was truly a babe repellent, even though i figured out how to double clutch the thing to make certain i didn’t “grind a pound” every time i shifted to first-gear. even so, the valiant still represented possibilities and made promises to me (that it virtually never kept, i must admit). 

still, everything was possible (in car). 

sundays, dad always would say “let’s go for a little ride”. off we’d go: mom, dad and me in the other family car, the ’63 chrysler newport with push-button transmission, power steering and power brakes and both front and rear am radio speakers. this one had aftermarket a/c even though dad bought it brand new from the next not-as-little town over chrysler-plymouth dealer. ah, a big v8 and torsion-quiet ride, big whitewalls, bias-ply tires and full wheel covers – chrome everywhere – bling! someday this will be mine i thought.

this car would be a babe magnet, i was sure of it.

today, some of us, probably most of us, have lost that sense of possibility when we get behind the wheel, after all most americans are getting into appliances, machines that simply cannot be anthropomorphized; and we’re getting to roads that allow movement like a pig through a python. in fact, if the 16-year-old's on my street are any indication, the future drivers aren’t even interested in driving until mom and dad make them by telling them “we’re not going to continue being your taxi service any more”.

then, the automobile gave us a sense of excitement, perhaps danger (benign danger, mostly, but we certainly thought we were baaaad dudes: ""man, c'mon let's un-tuck our shirts and put masking tape over the word, 'root' on our root beer bottles"") – a sense that we were darn near outlaws, men (boys, really) without rules, barely a code, to constrain our freedoms. woo hoo, “we're back in the saddle again”.

today, we’re mostly left with a deteriorating highway infrastructure that really can be dangerous, but driving car that are, if nothing else, certainly very much less deadly but mostly without any gravitational pull. the fact that a kia (fill in the blank) or toyota (fill in the blank) is quicker, faster, safer, almost pollution free (by comparison), comfortable as can be and will have power everything, possibly gps and probably am, fm, and satellite radio, plus cd, bluetooth and iphone connectivity for the ipod function doesn’t forgive the allure that even in “se” guise these appliances lack. i mean, really, my piece-of-crap volkswagen volkswagen had more allure than many of the things that pass as car today possess – combined. 

not many of us care either, as a glance or even a stare out of your office window to the highway below can attest. the car go by and perhaps one in fifty is worth another second or two of your gaze. in a few short years, certainly less than a decade, the car will be driving themselves about 75% of the time, because no one gives a damn. the car lack allure. we’re over them. if there were unlimited mass-transit ""tubes"" that you could hop in and out of on a whim, well hell, why bother at all to go for another new mazda or chevrolet or ford or dodge (fill in the blank)? nothing to see here, move along, you’ve got homes, let’s get to ‘em.

those of us on the entry level (or premium class) luxury performance board here know about allure – fn’s trip to europe driving a new bmw (his bmw, not a rental), now that’s what we should all aspire to. we’re again on the precipice. again? yep, we’re about to lose something we’ve always had – the sense that our car are an extension of ourselves, hand-in-glove, everything’s possible (when we're in our car). gone, too, is the romance of the “little ride” with our parents or with our children. the thrill (of the next time i get to drive) is gone (one hopes not forever) for many. the romance, nay, the sex-appeal of sliding in behind the wheel of your new chevrolet chevrolet almost has no contemporary analogy except for those who allow themselves at least a $50,000 car purchase.

does it really take $50,000 to get allure? and, if so, how did it come to this? my father was a 6th grade math teacher, my mom a librarian, almost all car purchased were “previously owned” (there were only 2 exceptions out of all the car they ever bought that i can recall), yet “my” car, my piece-of-crap car were alluring, exciting, almost thrilling. i contend it is not necessary to spend $50,000 or more for an alluring car. i also contend that there are few car companies that realize they are killing or perhaps already have killed their future customers' interest in their products by not building alluring car at virtually every price point. [frankly, kia may be one of the few exceptions despite my inclusion re: non-alluring and comments above.]

now where did i put the keys to that valiant?"

with sales of the acura last month down to 930 car, i'd say the writing is probably on the wall. acura saved at least a billion dollars by keeping the 2019 acura on the 2012 honda platform rather than making an all-new car with the 2016 honda platform—and they've passed that savings on to the customer. but unless sales somehow explode my guess is that we're only a few years away from the end of the acura. we'll see.

one weird little factoid is that when the acura was first introduced for model year 2013 the list price for the base model was $25,900. and now six years later the base price of the acura is again exactly the same—$25,900. but the 2013 acura had the comparatively underpowered 2.0 engine as well as a lackluster 5-speed automatic transmission. the 2019 acura has the tlx's 2.4 plus the tlx's 8-speed dual clutch transmission with torque converter. plus the 2019 acura has a better interior than the 2013, a quieter ride, acurawatch, etc. when you account for inflation 25,900 in today's dollars would be about 29k. in other words, the 2019 acura is a much better car with a huge price cut from 2013. but it's still difficult to get around the fact that it's a massively updated and improved 6-year old car—even if the price is now pretty compelling. perhaps another upside is that it should be completely debugged. that seems to be the case with my 2018 tlx too."

presumably, the s4 will be longer and wider, so perhaps the size, not the hp will mitigate and dilute the temptation to cross shop. or perhaps the rs3 will be priced out of reach compared to the s4. now, then, this makes me wonder if audi may think it needs a non-avant rs4 to go up against bmw and mercedes-benz benz high zoot models (now that the rs5 is gone).

if history is repeated, the new s4 will not take a breathtaking leap up in msrp, but will take more than an evolutionary leap in content and refinement.

-weighs in at 3594 lbs.
-40:60 torque split front to back with standard audi

i heard the bad news that not only did someone at audi make the horrific decision to de-content the new upcoming s4 with a slushy 8 speed zf auto, but they also decided not to make the 6-speed manual an option.

if this is true, audi should really just make the s4 with a cvt and call it a day since that would suit the customers this move is intended to impress. 

if the manual was made available, and my '14 s4 was totaled in the near future (hope not, but hypothetically speaking), the lack of a dsg option would make me get the 6-speed manual if available, if i was getting another new s4.

,,"when we were blessed with having our 3rd child, we needed a bigger vehicle with the ability to handle new england winters, haul kids' stuff, and hold at least 3 (our vey are they big) child safety seat. we bought a 2011 honda. given the fact that the acura was less than 2 years old at the time i didn't want to take a steep depreciation hit, so i kept it, made the honda my wife's daily driver, & put my beloved honda into semi retirement.

my acura was a nice car. excellent fit & finish. the 2.4l 4 banger loves to rev. the transmission is crisp and doesn't struggle keeping the engine in its sweet spot. the suspension is tuned to allow road feel. it's good, until i drove the bmw.

the electric power steering is artificial and lifeless. the brakes are weak."
,,"i saw the bmw announcement yesterday with regards to the drivetrain bump in the ""new"" models. i always felt that the 6 cyl twin scroll turbo was uner rated to begin with. that said, i had the performance pack upgrade in mine, which according to bmw, upped the hp and torque ratings by about 20 each. so, not sure if they just applied those engine management changes to the current motor, or they did something more ""physical"" to massage the engine..

the thing that will haunt the 3/4 series is the continued interiors they design. you look at the ats, the audi, the c300, and the bmw interior needs some serious rework. i liked mine (2011). but, it could have used a shot of style. even with the new models, the interior could use more panache, especially considering what the competition is doing.

ld....my sister, who traded her 8 year old jag in for a mercedes-benz benz was bemoaning not going back to jaguar for her new car. she likes her mercedes-benz benz. she liked her old jag more, though.

funny thing is, jag is doing much better since they've been out from under ford's thumb. i'm not a ""jag"" kind of guy (unless it's a vintage xke roadster), but i do understand their appeal.

we went ahead and got the audi care mntce programs -- something missed on both the acura and the infiniti. the premium car we have had experience with are always very pricey to maintain -- even the infiniti. on the other hand, the service departments at acura, audi, bmw and infiniti have always been delightful in terms of giving customers the red carpet treatment.

we bought the audi and leased the s4. don't laugh, but we have never purchased a car -- it is scary, since we have always felt that houses should be purchased and car should be rented. 

those folks who have never leased, probably don't get why we have some fear and trepidation about buying. i guess it is like getting married vs living together. buying seems like a commitment, leasing not so much. car however are transitory, ephemeral -- so, to us buying is a scary proposition.

interesting, now i came from a base suspension 320, to a base suspension 330i and the two are worlds difference. the 330 feels more planted, doesn't want to push as much in the corner and i know i can take my fave on and off ramps faster. i feel that the base suspension on the 2016 and newer 3 series is better than before. now rick's gt has the adaptive suspension and i like it, i wish mine had it.. but overall i can't see how a mazda 6 would come close to a base 3 series on a road course or figure 8"

i did rent a volkswagen earlier this year. there are similarities to audi...certain switches, handles, styling (especially the center stack and dash), etc. however, this is true for many brands. i don't see gm making different window switches for cadillac when they can use the ones from buick, just as one example.
is a honda a ""humble"" basis for an acura? i dunno....depends on how you look at it. an honda is certainly a very good starting point for an acura.
i'm excited about the upcoming tlx. as i normally do, if in a couple of years, i decide to make a trade, the tlx will be tops on my list.

do we now tell our children, their teachers, our leaders, etc, that it is ""ok"" to not go for great?

how could it belittle anyone to urge them to strive for ""the best"" (at every price point) -- i've not suggested that the customer who shops for a chevrolet is any less entitled to the best (at that price point) than is the rolls buyer (at that price point).

everything made and done is not great -- i assume we all would agree to that. i am hoping to chevrolet the conversation to perhaps contemplate that we simply shouldn't settle for good enough no matter how much or little we pay.

i just think that good enough or good has begat an erosion of what we'll accept -- hence the term dumbing-down. we, at times, seem complacent -- we accept good enough, we don't ""demand"" great.

i actually found the previous generation audi and volkswagen to differ greatly. however, with the volkswagen continually making many improvements, i find the 2015 volkswagen to finally be up to snuff. of course, since they've caught up at volkswagen with the volkswagen to the audi, they no longer offer a 5-door audi (although i think that's changing with the audi e-tron's)."

nice car, but weird looking, kind of a knight in armor without the knight.

the volvo is the dark horse. good value, safe, distinctive, reliable and more affordable. again though i'm not sold on the look or performance reviews i read. perhaps again if i see one in person in a color and trim i like and test drive it, that will come out ahead.

,,"i would agree with you that mercedes-benz benz is improving the ""sport"" factor, but that's somewhat of a relative improvement. even with their improvements, and in spite of bmw's steering and audi's weight, i would still put mercedes-benz benz solidly in third place ranking those brands on overall enthusiastic driving dynamics. i am basing this on three categories of comparison, most of which i've driven over the past 12 months:

c350 vs. audi/s4 vs. bmw
e350/550 vs. audi/s6 vs. bmw/550i 
slk vs. tts vs. z4 (although none of these are within a mile of a boxster s)

that probably suits mercedes-benz benz ok. i don't think they are trying to compete with bmw and audi for the serious driving enthusiast in these segments, as evidenced by no manual transmissions, a chassis emphasis on toyota rather than handling and slush box automatics vs. dsg's. but, to their credit, they are closing the gap a bit and making the choice of mercedes-benz benz for luxury not as much of a tradeoff. unfortunately bmw appears to be inadvertently helping them to close this gap from the other (wrong) direction."
,,"i'm a big fan of dedicated snow tires, too. if you pitted a rwd or fwd car with dedicated snows against an awd car with all seasons, it'd be pretty close. the awd would probably be better on gaining traction for acceleration, but in steering, braking and handling i think the 2wd would beat it every time."
,,"warped rotors make a sound and usually a feel. the term that describes the feel is shudder or shuddering. the sound that is made will remind you of the sound you hear when your abs brakes are activated. the abs could be said to pulse rapidly -- typically the warp sensation although similar to the pulsing sensation of abs is somewhat more violent.

the higher the speed the more the shuddering is noticeable and the louder it is too. as the warp becomes more and more severe, the onset of the shuddering is at lower and lower speeds. mine was seemingly cured by the rotors being resurfaced or turned as it is called.

some rotors cannot be turned without serious longentivity issues. acura claims their rotors are thick enough to withstand up to three turns. 

the price of the rotors at an acura dealer (front pair) installed is about $350 for new acura replacements.

acura's brakes are fine for most normal driving, but they seem a bit delicate and are not fans of heat (not that any rotors are, it's just that acura's seem particularly prone to disliking heat.) i can't imagine having this car in the mountains or living with mountains with brakes as intolerant of heat as these.

i have no idea why (other than $) a more durable or heat tolerant rotor is not used, especially when we're probably talking about a relatively small $ number to set the car up with bullet proof brakes.

many of the important items you'll get with any of the car you've listed. as some others have pointed out i think the back seat may pose the biggest challenge. i think the es or even the audi might serve best in this area. since low maintenance cost over 200k miles is important, personally i'd flunk the german brands out. on both my es and rx, i just did routine services over both vehicles with each exceeding 150k miles, so my experience with lexus regarding low cost maintenance was great. however bmw and audi with audi care provide free scheduled maintenance over 50k miles. however over 200k i'd expect service to cost more on these models.

your quiet and smooth to drive speaks lexus as well. my wife complains my bmw is a harsh ride since i have a sport package and low profile tires. speaking of the bmw, i have a 335. this car and the 328 are very different vehicles to drive, so drive them both to experience the difference. both are much more focused on sporty vs. luxury.

i know it may sound like blasphemy, but i'm really curious about the new 2015 hyundai 4-door sedan. priced here in the ellps pack, certainly doing a great cover as an ellps (wishing they were, i assume, an lps, which won't be too much of a stretch over the next few years, i'd imagine).
if i thought i could count on any of y'all to start mass quantities of test-drives, i'd pass on doing that, at this time.
my wife and i must be outliers -- test driving is a serious hobby for us; and it is free, and about every 36 months we drop about $100k or more on a couple of new car, and the dealer group we use to take our test drive adventures knows it, so there's always a willingness to let us go out and explore.
seems like a decent number of folks here probably do the same thing in terms of being in the market -- but y'all (and i grant i could be wrong) don't seem to be taking out the latest and greatest to see what's what.
think of it this way -- a new restaurant comes to town; i'm assuming most (51%) folks here eat out -- a lot -- well you probably give the new eatery a go. the characteristics of the ellps and lps ""buyers"" is (i've assumed with the data points y'all share here) would seem to indicate you're -- most of you anyway -- auto mavens (experts or connoisseurs). you like to ""dine"" (drive) the new restaurant (auto). true dat?
i also assume y'all subscribe to at least two of the ""big"" car magazines and devour them both in print and on-line.

,,"it's probably fine but as you all know, a turbo or supercharger will immediately exploit any unusual weakness inherent in the engine. you have maybe a higher mileage engine with a little weepiness in the head gasket? boom! that's gonna blow out of there. carbonized engine? bad tank of gas in your neighborhood? not a good thing with over-boosted turbo.
the reason that bmw sets the boost level where it does is, of course, so that the car maintains that nice balance of reliability, nice manners and decent performance. they compromise, in other words, on the side of longer life, stable idle, good mpg, etc. they are looking at the consequences from hundreds of thousands of car, not just one.

i gotta say, however, i am impressed they got the infiniti automatic to hit 60 mph in 5.4 secs. that's pretty darned good. and considering most other test i've seen of the 335 auto have it hitting 60 in under 5 secs, maybe it was a slow track day and the infiniti is even better than the 5.4 would indicate. either way, for a heavy auto coupe, that's good."

epa cargo volume = 13.2 cu ft for base and tech (14.3 cu ft for advance) 

epa total interior volume = 106.5/107.6 cu ft
compared to
as far as the honda comparison, the 2014 honda has an epa rated interior volume of 107.1 cu ft total. of this total, the cargo volume is 12.5 cu ft. **meaning that the passenger volume for the honda is 94.6 cu ft. **
even the honda is larger inside the passenger cabin than the 2015 tlx by 1.3 cu ft.
it is important to note that the 2014 honda provides 119 cu ft of interior volume. this is more than 10 cu ft more than the 2015 tlx that only has 107.6 in the advance model.
i assume the interior will be nicer than a honda, but i think my interest in the tlx has just died. i'm sure there are pros and cons about this, but i think i'm going to pass."

,,"the trick was in the tax structure, favoring diesels. that tax structure was justified by a doctored science, making the diesel engine look like a savior of the environment (vs. evil gasoline engine) due to lower carbon emissions, with nitrogen and particulate data using emission tests that were set up to produce appearance of much lower emissions than real life. as a result, the measured nitrogen oxide and particulate levels in cities did not go down and they tracked it to the emission test overstating the reduction of those emissions. in essence, if new diesel emission standards were followed using real life tests (similar to those in the us), there would be materially fewer engines certified in the marketplace (just like in the us), and those approved would be much more expensive. hence the ""con"". there are some other interesting particulars in diesel market in europe - like particulate filters that are often cut out by nissan drivers, because their replacement is horribly expensive, which defeats the purpose of the filter (this is more eastern europe phenomenon than western). also, it has been well documented that durability of those new breeds of diesel engines is well below what it was before and the maintenance is horribly expensive. premature failures of double mass wheels, emission systems (especially in situations of frequent short trips, when particulate filters don't have a chance to burn out), increased sensitivity to fuel quality, make those engines equally or even more fragile than gas engines. the old stinker could go for million miles on vegetable or heating oil, the new quiet, ""clean"" diesel, has a lifespan similar or sometimes shorter than the gas engine with higher costs of overhauls. the prices of diesel repairs of those new tdi engines at authorized garages are legendary over there (it's not unique to vag, same happens to mb, bmw, peugeot, or renault). 

european commission is trying to rectify the emission situation by tightening the standards to resemble american, but the issue is of course transition time. i believe once new enforcement is in place and costs of engines go up, the proportions of diesel engines in small car will revert to values similar to those prior the whole craze, which is more than in the us, but much less than today. the move is already happening, primarily due to equalized diesel fuel prices (that used to be much cheaper), observed increased maintenance cost and lower durability (majority of europeans, even in the west buy car for eight-ten years, not three or five), but tightening the standard will likely accelerate it.

americans never caught that bug, partially due to unrelenting of the us government on nitrogen oxide emission requirements. from what i understand it was also california that was even more ""anti-diesel"" than the feds. when you had fifth of the market excluded, there was little incentive for the manufacturers to even pursue the technology. after 20 years of apparently failed european experiment, it appears this was one of the few times, us/california governments did something right, even if not knowing why."

,,"breld: my s4 is a mechanical device and, like all such devices, isn't perfect. having said that, i am now north of 32,000 miles and, other than springing perhaps a little early for new tires, have nothing negative to report with respect to reliability, drive-ability, performance or efficiency. 

i ordered mine with a/s tires, which does set the top speed limit (which can be changed with a keystroke or two) to 130mph. mine is a premium+ model (dsg 7-speed transmission) with mmi/navigation plus, audi-side assist, full leather [no alcantara inserts] seat (in red), b&o sound system/speakers, audi-care and carbon fiber interior trim. it, with shipping, came to ~$57k; and i paid 94% of sticker (member of the audi club of na, discount of 6%).

at my own option, i have doubled the # of oil changes (i go in every 5,000 miles, meaning i pay for every-other oil change.) i have had the car mini detailed twice and a full-on inside and outside detail once (in the 22 or 23 months since i got it). i swapped the oe tires for conti's extreme contact dws/06's a couple thousand miles ago and the handling took a very big step up and road noise, already low, dropped even further.

i would get another one -- without any question (assuming the price doesn't shoot up like cadillac did to the cts line). i see no reason not to keep it until at least 90,000+ miles (based on its complete lack of any issues, thus far.)

i have no clue if these car hold their value better than or worse than whatever they might be shopped against -- my sense is at $57k, i would have had to take a lesser-contented bmw bmw x-drive. we've had 3 bmw's and this audi feels more powerful than any i6 bmw we've had, but since the audi is supercharged, this may not be a fair comparison. 

i wish the back seat had at least 1"" additional leg room, but since my 22 pound sheltie is usually the only rear seat passenger, it is not really a show stopper; besides the next gen ""audi/s4"" family will grow in size somewhat, so, again, if i knew then what i know now, i would, without hesitation repeat the acquisition of an s4.

my complaints -- one; the car came with wifi based on t-mobile 3g technology. if i actually could find and keep a 3g signal (instead, mine is mostly at 2g), i would be fine with the wifi performance. ultimately, my dealer showed me a secret method of adapting the carrier from t-mobile to at&t with some software coding and a new simm chip -- i am now, always in 3g. i read somewhere that the 2016 audi/s4's will offer 4g lte radios, solving the t-mobile (in our geography) performance issues.

love the feature of being able to google a destination by voice and having the sat nav take you there -- all hands free.

love the instant response of the power, the 7-speed dsg and the tuneage from the b&o speakers.

regrets? wish i had gone the extra $1,000 for the sport differential (audi's name for torque vectoring).

 after driving an s4, you will -- upon sliding behind the wheel of almost any other car -- wonder if the different car than the s4 is, somehow, broke. the 3.0t motor is damn near electric in feel as it whisks you effortlessly from 0 to 60, just about the time you reach the end of your . . . driveway. ruh roh! 

hope this helps. 

p.s. i am not too much of a believer that ""new models"" are prone to first-year glitches; i am a believer, however, that often the last year of a model's life-cycle provides the least amount of problem, often the greatest amount of content for the dollars spent and a pretty good chance of a deeper discount since there are no secrets. in other words, there will be a new, b9, audi/s4 model -- my 2017. the 2016's, therefore will have to have more content and a better deal in order to help dealers clear out the ""old"" inventory thus making room for the new. audi, i believe, has taken to delaying the availability of the new model until a certain threshold of sales of the old model has passed, therefore providing some ""value support"" both for the dealers and ultimately, of course, the buyers.

discounts will be there for 2016 audi/s4's -- but don't expect to see a $58,000 s4 for $48k just because there is a new 2017 in the pipeline."

the problem would be if infiniti priced the infiniti exactly the same as a bmw, offered exactly the same features and options, marketed the car as a direct competitor to the bmw, but fell short on driving dynamics. i don't think that's the case here.

personally, i think the bmw would fall into second place if i was buying a sedan today. at a price that is at or above $55k for a well optioned, performance model, it is way too close to the $65k+/- that i could buy an naturally aspirated 8,400 rpm bmw at. no comparison on driving dynamics, period. but that's my value judgement and someone else's is likely to be different."

and to be fair, the new cts is priced right in line with the car that gm sees as its key competitors: the mercedes-benz benz e class, the bmw bmw, and audi's audi. 

but cadillac's customers aren't used to paying those kinds of prices, and some are shopping elsewhere. meanwhile, bmw and mercedes-benz benz buyers aren't (yet) flocking to cadillac's showrooms to make up the difference. 

in other words, cadillac is losing its old customers -- but isn't yet winning enough new ones to make up the difference. so, why isn't cadillac trimming its prices?

not long ago, a price cut would have been gm's response. but these days, cadillac is under new management -- and its new president, longtime audi executive johan de nysschen, ordered something different: a big cut in production at the factory that makes the two sedan."

,,"well, blowing somebody at lights is not my concern, but if wanted to my previous subarus would do just fine. i also would rather take a car without personality than with a bad one. 

the aging argument on german car depends on what we are talking about. the chassis, main mechanicals, as long as maintained and not abused are probably fine for long. however, i would not be so sure about electrical system, motors, switches, etc. i think at some point germans could not resist replacing $20/50000 hrs with one for $5/8000 hrs (just example, not real numbers) on false calculation of short-term ownership by first owner and they are slowly working back that lapse of judgement. 

there is also their high maintenance-high complexity culture that has been present for decades (their war machines were like that, too, e.g. panther tank required fully equipped shop to replace transmission and it had to be taken apart - allied/russian tanks could have field tranny replacements; even its staggered wheel pattern made it more difficult to field replace the tracks on the field). 

every design has it objectives and constraints. at some point, getting closer to objectives (more performance in a car, better performing armored battle vehicle) comes at price of maintenance, complexity, which in turn can adversely affect the primary objectives in long term. in simple words, while working the machine has no equal, but to make it work can be cost prohibitive and even small setback has a potential becoming a major problem."

sales manager i spoke to was there. he came over, shook my hand. told me he was working a deal but got the keys for the s3 and told me to take it for a spin. he asked if i wanted his used car manager to look at my cts....no!!!!!!!!!

onward...pretty car in the metallic white still a bit cramped but felt a bit aierier than the is350 i tests drove awhile ago. ride is much better with the all seasons. probably give up a little at the edges of handling, but the all season certainly would make the car more liveable on a day-to-day basis.

seat are good, but not as good as the tl's or the cts's. not off by much, though. they were actually better looking than the ones i had in my previous s4. but, my s4 seat didn't have soft leather inserts, either.

faster than my cts by a good meadure, although the motor is still a 2.0 turbo with more hp but less torque. weight (less on the s3), gearing and the dsg trans are what i attribute that, too. but, the cts is roomier. in truth, it felt about as fast as my s4.

nice interior, as expected. much less in the way of controls, especially on the console vs my s4. not sure one is better than the other, just different. this one had the handwriting recognition. in my brief time with it, it was hit and miss. lcd pollping up out of the dash is way cooler than the tacked on screen with mercedes-benz benz or bmw. i'm used to my cts's interface and have mastered it. i have familiarity with the audi mmi. not much has changed from what i remember.

handled well, rear danced a tad over some bumps, but it wasn't too bad. never felt that in my s4, tl nor my cts. like the cts, lots of torque low. i like that. not much is going to blow by you in the s3.

steering was direct. i liked the steering wheel a lot, but i liked the one in the s4 a lot, too.

b&o stereo still trails the els in the tl and the (believe it or not) uplevel bose in the cts.

stickered for nearly $49k. after a nice 30 minute run, i went back to the dealership, with only one customer taking delivery of an audi. sm asked how i liked it. i told him that for the money, i'd choose it over a bmw or c300. first, that kind of sticker will barely touch either of those car. and, the s3 will outperform both.

he said he'd entice me by offering 5% off msrp. not in the market, and he knew i had an aversion to audi.

i guess it all comes down to if you find the current generation volkswagen an econobox or not. i found it to be quite well detailed and trimmed inside and out. the chassis is strong, tight, and light. all good things. i haven't test driven the volkswagen r yet; that's the next step. i'd bet money the rare flaws i found in the mexican built golfs/sportwagens is non-existent in the german built r. another big-time plus for the r in my book vs. other volkswagen's. that alone makes it not just ""another"" volkswagen to me. 

i will say the dsg in the tdi volkswagen is lazy. i would bet more money it doesn't have the same programming in the r. 

as to what the volkswagen volkswagen se is missing vs. my s4:

1) hp, quickness, and speed. 
2) real leather interior (though i like the pleather volkswagen is using). r uses real leather seating surfaces. 
3) it is smaller; though more utility possibilities and flexibility with hatch design. 
4) volkswagen doesn't have audi drive adjustable settings for steering, exhaust, shifting, and other characteristics (toyota, auto, sport), but i think the r does. 
5) the hatch doesn't open on its own with the push of a remote button like the s4 trunk. 
6) surprisingly, i think the volkswagen's do pretty much all have push-button start, rear-view cameras these days.
7) no electronic parking brake on the wagon se (big handle still); though the r might?

seriously, never had a keyless entry car - too advanced for porsche, i guess - but a friend has had numerous problem with his. he works for fox news and apparantly the electromagnetic interference from the broadcast tower screws up his keyless entry. and ""joe torque-wrench"" in the service department isn't that great at listening to his complaints. 

i'm of the opinion that all these techno/electronic do-dads that don't add to the driving experience are conspiring to force people to sell their car before the warranty expires. our acura navigation system (control unit) has been replaced twice in 2.5 years. the chances of me keeping another car 13 years and 155k miles like my 1995 nissan are slim to none. fine if you can afford to trade every 4 years, but that's not the strategy i used to get into a 911 in the first place.

i fitted the 2.3 di turbo in my ms3 with a low restriction ms intake as well as an extremely conservative ecu remap; while the n55 does produce appreciably more torque below 2800 rpm, from 2800 rpm to 6000 rpm the 2.3 cranks out 20 lb-ft to 44 lb-ft more torque. which motor is ""best"" depends on one's personal preference. in my case, the 2.3 power curve fits both the car and my driving style- and with a 0-100 time in the mid twelves i can refer to the ms3 as ""quick"" with a reasonably straight face.
my 135 was definitely fast, especially after i added the tune, downpipes, and intake. but the curve still wasn't as fat and flat as the caddy's feels. for example, if i was in the wrong gear in the bimmer, it would just fall flat, while that doesn't seem to be the case in the cts. of course, an extra 20% of displacement probably has alot to do with that."

with my first luxury dealership servicing experience with audi (they used to give free maintenance for 50k miles), i feel as if problem on a luxury car are not nearly as big of a deal. if they give you a nice loaner car, it makes it even less troublesome. i look at the bright side; you get a chance to wear and tear there car's rather than your own. no miles on your own car while they work on it makes me feel like i'm in no hurry. of course, my longest repair job came when i got an audi loaner, which wasn't typical at my old audi dealership. i have a feeling that's why miramar audi is now know as audi of san diego and under different ownership. i ratted them out on customer service audi surveys as routinely giving enterprise kia sephias and chevrolet chevrolet's instead of audi or volkswagen's.

the infiniti dodge has almost the same exact options as a toyota v6. they dropped the base model as well and now relegate that to the infiniti where it belongs. the infiniti starts out at the mid level trim. most of the options aren't really required, either, and the car rides far too hard with the sport tires or sport package. hence why, imo, it's not a real luxury car - though it is a good upscale sport sedan like the 3 series.

truecar has one for $32320 near me. and it's not the end of the year - there's no incentives going on right now. 

it's $27k even for a toyota v6 xle (no options, either) - no incentives, ever. like i said - it's a fantastic deal and a better replacement for the tired and boring toyota in any case. for 4-5k more, it's a no-brainer, really. it represents what i feel is the best value for the dollar currently on the market. and for 90% of people who have never had either a proper luxury car or a proper sports car, it's going to feel like they won the lottery compared to their old car.

the s4 is a combination of aluminum, ultra high strength steel, and steel components. it appears the aluminum sub-frame of the suspension got knocked out of place affecting the left side though the impact was on the right. they said they were able to adjust it the 2nd day at the dealership to meet specs. i think unlike toyota (in general), an audi authorized body shop doesn't try to mess around and do things ""half-way."" there's only 3 body shops that qualify for ""audi certified"" in all of san diego county. a good example is that on the first day at the dealership, they didn't try to magically adjust parts out of spec to meet spec. they admitted it didn't meet spec and worked on the car longer to get it right. in a way; this is a good thing; although my rental will now be around $1,400 due to the extended delays. i think they know the typical audi owner is meticulous with attention to detail. after all, they didn't settle for a volkswagen. 
the body shop will get the car back first thing monday morning, do a test drive by driving the vehicle back to the shop (what happens if they wreck on the way back?) after that, he said they had a good 1.5 days of work finishing up the buffing, polishing, and detailing on the panels that were repainted (a majority of panels by the way due to blending).
i hope i don't face delays like you did, because the more that is eaten up by rental costs out of the guy's $10k insurance limit, the harder it will be for me to collect decent diminished value.
when i told geico to put what they told me over the phone in writing (that they'd defer to me to be made whole first from the 10k, then come in afterwards), they balked. they said let's wait and see what mercury agrees to pay for dv and other things first, then we'll talk. i sent a demand letter to mercury for 15% of the total purchase price $55k (including fees/taxes) = $8,250 for dv alone. i added a caveat that this was to settle fast and quickly without me having to pay professional appraisers and incur additional costs. i told them if they force me to go further, i will no longer negotiate the highest of my consultants estimates, whereas right now i might negotiate down a bit to just get it over with.
if there are ongoing issues with the car, i think now is the time to state for the record i thought the car should of been totaled from the beginning. at least then i can say ""i told you so,"" and your adjuster was off by somewhere near 25% (incompetent or grossly negligent estimate)."

qnd observation: my last two audis were a 2005 audi followed by a 2009 audi -- the s4 dash and controls are little changed from those two car (which is more than fine by me). however, the s4 mmi seems to have transformed the car almost into a computer, there are so many features and functions that are controlled by the mmi.

so who would pay bmw premium to get a 320i with lower horsepower? i am quoting from an article that i read online (http://www.bimmer-mag.com/issues/120/articles/practical-considerations?page=4#.u4odyagweg0):
beyond that entry-level buyer, here’s who should also consider the 320i: urban commuters seeking bmw handling, luxury, connectivity and panache, and those upon whom the harsh realization has dawned that they don’t need a rocket car to satisfy their daily driving needs. from stoplight-to-stoplight, it would be rather nice to use less gas, and it’s equally nice to spend less money. the 36-month lease payment is $50 less for the 320i than that for the bmw, and even though the latter is much quicker and potentially faster, you won’t miss that sitting in traffic. the two car are virtually indistinguishable at light throttle under 40 mph. why pay more?
that's me going from a bmw bmw to 320i. i save $200 per month on my lease and i am actually having more fun with the 320i. maybe because its lighter, not sure, but it feels just more lively and the handling is so much more precise.
i could have gone with ford st or infiniti and saved some more money (for some reason the volkswagen and audi lease much higher due to really bad residuals), but decided to stay with bmw, since having had it before, i knew exactly what i was getting - a rwd sedan that handles great and is lot of fun to drive in around the honda."

seriously, money to lower a lease payment is somewhat hard to justify these days. if $2,995 lowers the mo pay by $100 for 36 months, wouldn't it be acceptable to put the money in an account and know that at least you've got 30 of the next 36 payments (the $100 difference, that is) accounted for?
let's not assume we know how better to spend someone else's money.
i've learned a lot from edmunds and audi world, etc; i used to think putting something toward the lease was at least ok. now i think differently -- but that is certainly in part due to the participation of many folks here. i found my stupidity is incurable, i found my ignorance could be cured, however.

best of all, there’s a lot more driving fun than you’d expect in an entry-level scooter, especially considering its front struts, rear torsion beam setup. its progressive and predictable in its behavior, so much so, you might wonder when the hot hatch variant will arrive, something you would never say of a kia rio in past form.
it lacks the expected korean floatiness and excessive brake dive, even at extremes. take a corner too fast, brake hard and crank the wheel and the rio will scrub off speed while maintaining way more grip than you’d come to expect. credit the car’s rigid structure; the suspension pieces themselves are nothing special.

when it comes to tech, kia has you covered with bluetooth, a six-speaker stereo with satellite radio and a rear-view camera system, seven-inch touchscreen infotainment system with android auto and apple carplay. standard safety features include six airbags, side-impact door beams, electronic stability control, anti-lock brakes, hill-start assist and vehicle stability management.

there's a brand new 2018 kia rio5 over at george gee kia in spokane valley, wa, selling for $14,795. 6-speed stick model.


that does it- the 2er and bmw are going on craigslist and i'm headed to the kia store!!!"

the acura does look nice, and the interior was always good. same exact drivetrain as the 4 cyl. tlx. the tlx just had a little more room inside and better suspension. i don't think they changed that much on the new acura, but it does seem like a good value."
,,"i figured more than less that it is.
i will hold on some more to my pearly white sh.
i am hoping that the new model year will look more european and not like what i am seeing coming out of japan right now- lexus and infiniti."
,,not with all your modifications i agree but it looks like the word is getting to acura design team
,,"acura tlx
there are (were) many good things to be said (and enjoyed) about the current tl sh-awd (in advance trim) -- trouble is (was) i often found myself ""apologizing"" for the acura's styling and ""cheap looking"" (for the class it was aspiring to compete in) ""over-honda-ized"" interior.
the concept version is quite the step up in the styling department; but, i think the same can be said for the infiniti infiniti, too. and, well, talk about piling on -- the infiniti can't get no love from nobody, well maybe a little bit from popular mechanics.
i did then and still do today liken the tl in sh-awd advance form as acura's s4 (for a lot less $). now that i have a '14 s4, i do appreciate it [the s4] even more -- but the inherent goodness of the tl sh-awd remains and, hopefully, will continue and grow in the updated tlx. if the price of the tlx sh-awd advance can stay under $50k, it ought to be a winner just so long as it [the tlx] doesn't lose the performance bits and driver involvement of the outgoing tl (this -- reduced driver involvement -- seems to be the main complaint about the infiniti, as i recall).
i had thought acura had all but given up wanting to compete with the premium germans and the other premium japanese offerings. it would seem the tlx could knock the infiniti to last place and maybe even breathe down the is 350's neck (assuming the acura in fwd trim is not compared with the is in either rear or awd configuration).
perhaps things will get interesting again -- it was starting (for a while there) to look like the is was going to be the only current japanese premium sporty sedan. this new tlx sh-awd could turn the corner and the tide for that matter.
i'll probably not make any friends for saying this, but: in this class (audi, 3 series, c class, ats, is, infiniti etc), there should be no fwd only models (unless and only unless a customer wants to special order one). yes, i know the audi is offered in an fwd configuration (somewhere) -- but of the 5 or so audi dealers i am aware of there are no, zero, none, nadda, fwd audi's (i don't even know if you could order one if you tried) available and the dealers have no intention of ever having one (again, assuming you can get one, even.)
the new audi and the new ""baby mercedes-benz benz 4-door coupe"" may come as fwd models and the dealer body may elect to stock a few to attract more potential (and younger, perhaps?) customers, and that is fine. but at the ellps (premium models) rwd and/or awd are expected -- and here in cincinnati awd bmw's look to overtake the rwd versions soon if they haven't already (and the awd trend is thus in mercedes-benz benz, cadillac, infiniti and lexus for many models).
having the tlx offered with fwd makes a statement -- something like ""take the 'p' out of ellps."" i would think it is a message acura doesn't want to promote (given the overwhelming success -- he said sarcastically -- of the fwd acura.)
in our fair honda, the honda dealership is ""real close"" (geographically) to the acura store -- i would think some would shop a honda after seeing the sticker on an fwd tlx. the tlx needs to make at least good run at being a performance model -- and it will be hard pressed, today, to do that as a front driver.
of course, i could be wrong -- just not uncertain.
dilyl"
,,"obviously, i had a typo in that statement. it should have been:

i'm not an economics guy by any stretch of the imagination (nor am i a world traveler), mind you, but i'm pretty sure something just simply costing more there doesn't means it is more expensive in relation to the average joe.

just keep in mind, regardless of whether you find it cute or not, it doesn't mean what i said is incorrect. everything is relative. yes, if everything you say is true, then the car apparently cost a larger portion of their income (although i have no idea why). but since everything appears to be that way from what you are saying, then it is relatively on par with all living expenses, if you get my meaning.

its the same thing from state to state here. gas, food, taxes, real estate all vary widely across the country. i could live as a king in texas for pauper wages in nj. 

hell, i'm middle management and i sure can't afford a new bimmer."
,,"a fwd sport sedan can be very fun and satisfying once you figure out the ""magic"" of driving them properly - brake later on corner entry, trail brake deeper into the corner, turn sharper to a later apex, and straighten the wheel for track out sooner so you can get on the gas. it's a different line than conventional rwd, but once you master it, it can be just as quick as a ""rwd line"" - though i admit, it's not as much fun.

for me, this is the biggest challenge in my move to fwd. i'm essentially re-wiring myself to enter deeper into a corner before really applying the brakes. the rwd line is still more fun for me but i'm sure after some time i'll get used to the notion of putting the weight on the front of the car for hard cornering."
,,"i agree people can do what they want, but how much goes down on that $329 bmw lease, 3 or 4 thousand? if they have that kind of money to put down on a lease they could just buy a pretty good used car for that, no it won't be fancy, but it would be more financially sound, that said that certainly isn't what they have to do, and they are free to go for the fancy car if they want, it is one of the reasons we live in the area we do, people are allowed to make their own decisions, but they are also supposed to live with the consequences of those decisions, not go blaming someone else for them and ask for handouts. anyway i am getting off topics so i am going to stop."

of course it might look better in person and of course how it actually drives is very important. it looks like there is no room in the back seat so maybe it's a 2+2?
the price point is really going to matter with this car. the mini isn't available in most places like bmw's so if they price it well over a mini which for me is going to be about 100 miles away, service would be a big problem. so no mini for me. this has possibilities but not if they overprice it. i think they need to base the 135i at about $27k. much higher and you start competing with all kinds of car."

es350 or toyota (now the toyota)
tl or honda
infiniti or nissan or nissan

and since audi is in question as well, why not get the volkswagen gli versus an audi fw? people like to compare all these vehicles to each other and assume that the mainstream ones drive and feel the same as their luxury counterparts. the answer is no. i drove the honda and i though it was a lot of car for the money. however not at the same level of the tl. i actually liked it and would have been a strong possibility. but when i looked at tl, i really thought i was getting more for the money. the newer se trim is fantastic. i liked the looks and the drive. the leather and seat are top notch. the interior was a step above. the 18 inch tires and wheels were a knockout. the spoiler is super cool. both the suspension and the driving dynamics are different. so the car might be very similar in many respects, but the car are very different. to answer your question, i think i can get the $4500 price difference when the time comes to sell it. if not, hopefully, i will feel that based on what i paid, i got my monies worth. 

i know looks are very subjective so what looks good to one my not look good to another. i think the newer version of the tl looks great. the new honda would have been a fine choice too, but the small acura premium was worth it to me."

near means close, but not quite, or next to, or in the vacinity of. :p

and why can't i compare the prices? an bmw depreciates the same as any other bmw. it just has a much higher initial price, and price gouging is never accounted for in resale. the depreciation is relatively the same. limited edition or not, it's still an outdated model. the mass produced thing is also relative. i believe someone (wasn't it you?) said there are actually more m5s in the states than there are v8 bmw, year-to-year. that would make a v8 non-m bmw more exclusive and rare than an bmw. so my 550i sport should theoretically hold it's relative value better than an bmw!  especially with it being a stick."

when it comes to lease prices, the leases are better on the bmw then infiniti and usually by a great deal.

regarding your comment about if its more it has to be better, if the sum of all the parts are better, then yes its better. this is why bmw has been picked over the g series car over and over. the bmw pedals are set up for heal and toe, the transmission is smoother, the engine is smooth, the brakes work better. i haven't taken my 3 series on the track, this will change in 2 weeks, i'll be able to tell you more than. 

regarding the new turbo 4 in the 3 series, i was able to drive a new z4 with the engine in it, have to say, the power build up is better then the i6, its harsher then the i6 but the z4 is faster with the i4. so i suspect the new 3 series will be faster too.with a few bolt on's the new turbo 4 should be able to make 300hp with out breaking a sweat.

everything i read to this day still says awd is the preferable option for winter weather traveling and i concur with my own personal experience.

to me, there is usally only a 1-2 mpg difference between awd and rwd so mise well not take the chance and sacrifice a little mpg. personally, i like that infiniti has awd option and not awd all the time like subaru and others. this way, 85% of the year i can use just the rwd with better fuel economy and just use awd when i need it specifically.

,,"the 4g fwd tl is less sporty in my opinion then the 7g fwd nissan, not by much but enough i noticed a difference. the nissan had a slightly firmer/sportier ride and feedback, slightly better handling, and the look of the actual vehicle was sportier. your right the cvt in sport mode does help to give the shift shock imitation, which is important in the feedback department, louder exhaust note upon acceleration when gunning it compared to regular drive, and the engine revs as you mentioned, all of which provides the sportier needs anyone would want from a regular a/t. 

now, once you move up to the awd 6 m/t version of the 4g tl, that the tl becomes sportier than the new nissan, but the base version is definitely tamer then the new nissan.

remember, a lot of people have valid critisms and hatred of the cvt b/c of what happened with the 1g version of it from 2003-2008. since 2009, all the nissan products have the updated 2g cvt which is much more efficient, less troubles, and far fewer problem then the 1g had. nissan extended the transmission warranty so the cvt for them is here to stay! so far i overall really like the cvt and the fuel econ for 290hp is absolutely fabulous."

the acura is a nice step up from the old acura -- in terms of ""styling."" in every other way that i can think of, the new acura is clearly a nice, a fancier a ""better"" honda in about every way that i can think of.

at the current moment, i would look closely at a new bmw x1 (w the turbo i4) over the acura. i'd probably look at a audi over the acura, too.

now then, offer up the sh-awd on the acura and it becomes the pick of the litter since it would be a bargain, or at least one would think it ought to be.

http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-10/the-acura-acura-is-a-30-000-luxury-car-that-isn-t-really-a-luxury?cmpid=yhoo 
to be honest, that is the kind of review i would expect from a ""lifestyle"" writer: http://www.forbes.com/sites/hannahelliott/"
,,lots of read testing going on here; much like arguing about movies when you've only seen the trailers...
,,"the buick buick v8 may be a performance sedan, as is the chrysler 300c. however a performance sedan and a sports sedan are not quite the same thing. the 300c is a bit too big for a serious sports sedan, as is the bmw 7-series."
,,"i guess i'm coming 'round to the notion that -- and this is only for example purposes -- both the audi and audi could be called ellps vehicles (but if i am doing so it is kicking and screaming). this whole thing is so darned subjective though, since i still harbor the notion that (pre audi), the audi was ellps (even though you can crank the s4 to close to $70k) as [because?] the audi was an lps.

the ats is ellps as the cts is [now] lps; as 3 series is ellps as 5 series is lps.

now, when the cla and the audi came along (and to a certain extent the acura) we dropped from ""regular fit,"" to ""slim,"" and then finally to ""petite"" (sort of).

to some here el is an indication of price -- but even those who go to the trouble can find the $ range for a 3 series to be from $32k to $87k. 

i have -- historically -- thought of the ellps to be mostly a smaller version of the lps family. meaning size seems to (in my mind) still be a better trait than cost. hell, for the price of my s4, i could have had a premium+ audi, but the size would clearly differentiate them.

i had not (and mostly still don't) considered the possibility of an audi or cla or acura ever being considered for entry into the ellps class -- because of my [possibly wrongheaded] assertion that as nice (or expensive) as the [top o' the line] audi family (which is called an s3) is, well, it is smaller than the already el entrant, the audi.

just as we bumped the cts to the lps class and replaced the then ellps cts with the ats, we may -- soon -- find ourselves needing to do the same thing with the acura and audi.

today, however, knowing only what is out there, it doesn't seem [to me] right to have both the acura and the tlx called ellps car -- just like it doesn't seem right to bracket the cla and c class mercedes-benz benz as ellps car.

it seems that base price is the hang up -- not actual price -- for we don't seem to argue that a 5 series is an ellps anymore than we would argue an audi or e class is an ellps -- we don't because there are model designations downstream (in both size and price).

we have (or the manufacturers have) blurred the lines somewhat -- and it will be another cycle before the car are again (maybe) rationalized. 

an acura is an acura. 
an acura is a tarted up honda
a tlx has much more l + p than the acura
there is a car model, not just a badge, below the tlx -- and that is the acura.

currently the same breakdown is applicable to the audi and audi -- but the new audi will what? blur the lines further or sharpen the ford, make the two more readily differentiated? does anyone think the cts and ats are the same class of car -- even though the msrp of the ats can be made to significantly overlap the msrp of the cts.

and so on.

i'll settle -- internally -- for the tlx to be in the same class as the audi, 3 series and c class. i'll accept the audi and acura and cla as similar classified car. i just find it difficult to have both the audi and audi designated as ellps car if the 3 series is in the mix -- the 3 series is marketed against the audi and c class, not the audi and acura class.

i'm more willing to overlook driven wheels -- but my own money would only go for an awd vehicle knowing what i know and living in the climate i live in. this rules the acura out -- but keeps the tlx sh-awd firmly in the fold. 

this is getting difficult for me to keep straight. 

i love these forums, and i do not want to exclude anyone from them -- but for the sake of birds of a feather, so to speak, when i want to get into one of the forums, i'm not going to toyota into the full-sized pickup truck forum since my interests are probably not going to be well served there (and vice nissan).

i want to hear (read) your thoughts pertaining to similar vehicles -- i'm going to gravitate toward forums where the participants are interested in and experienced with 3 series, c class, b8 audis (audi's), tlx's infiniti's, etc, etc. i don't have interest in chevrolet (not that there is anything wrong with them or those who write about them) or lacrosses or 300's or 911's or stingrays (same). yes a fully tarted up s3 may give rise to a legitimate question about s3's vs audi's or s4's, but generally speaking these are meant to be separate models within the audi family.

besides, audi will soon be rolling out the b9 audi's which will, probably, crank up both the l and the p (and the price) further differentiating the audi and audi lines. mercedes-benz benz, bmw, acura, lexus and infiniti will almost certainly do the same thing. well, i think mercedes-benz benz already has with the new c class compared to the new cla class.

in any case, there needs to be a place to go to discuss the car that would appear to be competitive with each other. yes, i guess it is possible for someone to shop for an acura and drive out with a tlx sh-awd advance, just as it is possible to look at a 328 and drive out with a 335ix -- but, using the auto magazine comparison test reports as guides, it would be more typical for the audi to be tested against the 3 series or the c class not the audi tested against the c class and 3 series, etc.

my head hurts."
,,"""i was actually thinking of the audi as the perfect entry-level type car for acura. however, the honda is an economy car platform and will never have the refinement of the audi - which, i believe, is really just a smaller previous-gen audi.""

the audi is effectively a volkswagen in audi clothing; given that the volkswagen is a hotted up volkswagen, the original comment regarding the audi being based upon the lowly volkswagen is correct. said another way, there is virtually zero relationship between the audi and any previous generation audi; that said, the audi tt and the audi share a lot of dna."

,,"just had the 15,000 mile service on my '14 s4 s-tronic. while in, i also had the tires rotated and was comp'd a set of $69 wiper-blades, causing the computer to spit out the admonition that these freebies were a one-time deal. the service manager's good will was somewhat offset by the wag of the computer's finger.
i had no expectation of free wipers, but appreciate them, since i replace them every 15k as a matter of routine.
typical to the audi powerplants, i am now enjoying the 10,000+ mile break in surge of power. the engine that keeps on giving now even shows 30 or more mpg's from time-to-time, beating my 2009 2.0t audi (which had the 6-speed tiptronic.)
after driving the s6 recently, i am still smitten -- were $'s no object. but, if you're considering a $55k+ ellps, you owe it to yourself to drive one of these -- other's may come close, but -- for the money -- this is the one to beat. of course this is certified, 100% bias-free fact based commentary.
couple of program notes if you get serious about a 2015 s4:
if leasing go premium+

if buying at least consider prestige
get the full-leather seating

get the b&o sound-system

get mmi plus

get audi-side assist
consider audi-sport differential if you ever like to really carve into curves
debate the merits of sticking with the 18"" wheels -- even they come with 40series tires -- ride improves, tires cost less, last longer -- and if you axe me, the oem tires aren't the best anyway, so you'll want to consider replacing them. of course the 19"" wheels sure are purty.
the trim on the dash, doors etc, can be had in 3 flavors, look at examples of each, then decide.
paint is expensive -- if on a budget (what am i saying) get one of the free colors.
the video reviews and motor trend says 0-60 4.4 sec. the s3 may equal it, but there are several reviews all over the web that claim the s4 is quciker than audis published claims.
the audi connect is 3g -- it sucks (if it is t-mobile) -- great concept, crappy execution.
objectively  this is the best you can get, if you don't want to spend more.
if you want something for less $ that will satisfy your needs for speeds, etc, consider the acura tlx v6 w/sh-awd and in advance trim -- consider it a bargain s4, sort of.

the acura belongs here because, with the infiniti at least, it is arguably one of the sportiest, most fun-to-drive car in this category. i actually think it epitomizes the ellps segment right now. if you've never driven it, you just cannot imagine how the numbers don't tell the story of how the sum is greater than the parts. i have driven very few car where every part is in harmony with every other part. the engine, transmission, steering, switchgear, green house - it's just a joy to spend time with. it's not without faults, of course, but they disappear once you're rolling. it's like a symphony - seriously. i'll always remember mine as one of my favorites."

i bought the cds from best buy. all of them are ""non-compliant""? ipod came right from apple and ios updates came straight from apple's itunes web site. service manager says he understands my frustration. but, he did download some sort of firmware. he said i should test it when i ge the car back. i told him my ipod and cds are still in the car. all he has to do is to plug in the ipod or play a cd to see if they still cut out all the time.

he sounded frustrated, but said he would. when i inquired about the next step if it doesn't work, he said they'd have to remove the entire dash and colsole to get the mmi out...to replace the mmi. his feeling is if one didn't work, a new one, with the same software, may not work, either. i asked him what happens then? he said...""i don't know"". geesh!

,,"the intermediate shaft failures have scared me off the porsches. i really really wanted to get one this last time out ... just couldn't bring myself to take the risk. 

the reason for this is actually the oil. the engine was designed for high-zinc oils that are common in europe and were judged to be minimally acceptable in the u.s. at the time. but the epa drove the maximum levels to 1200ppm and people started to notice a few problem. then they dropped the levels to 800ppm and people started using synthetics with sometimes none of the original anti-wear additives in them. suddenly everyone's engines were eating themselves.

there is a company that makes a properly designed replacement part for it, though (new bearing sets), and if the vehicle doesn't have this ""upgrade"" already, then deduct the price from the vehicle as any of that series engine will eventually fail, guaranteed, without the mod, as you cannot physically buy high zinc oil in the u.s. any more due to the epa's idiocy. 

the problem was that the additives traditionally caused cats to die in 50-60k miles. now the government mandates 100k+ for cats, which meant less additives. the oil makers were caught in the middle. this is exactly like the paint fiasco that happened in the 80s and 90s, where paint was peeling off of car due to the epa requiring different types of paint formulations. eventually they fixed it around 2000 or so, but in this case, it's a generation of engines that won't make it past 150k, (anything that's based off of engineering previous to ~2000 or so) and some like the boxster and rotary engines that rev really fast just simply die in half that time. note - this also affects a lot of s2000s, which routinely get revved hard.

and, yes, it really does happen. i lost my 67 mercedes-benz benz' engine after two oil changes when the epa switched the levels without telling anyone. working fine and ~5000 miles later (was my daily driver at the time) the entire internals were shot. not even re-buildable. the oil simply provided no protection and it ate the top end, bottom end, the bearings, and even the gaskets. no smoke or issues and then a pile of parts. so i feel for the poor porsche owners as i've been there myself.

as of 2009, porsche has finally redesigned the engines and the problem are controlled if you use high mileage non-synthetic in the engines. (castrol or similar) but a lot of people still run racing oil in them and ignore the epa's ""requirements"". i'd do the same too, if i had a $50k porsche sitting in my driveway. better to be safe than sorry when a rebuild can cost 10k+ on these things.

all of that said, the boxster *is* a good ride. the one to stay away from, though, is the cayman s. it's significantly more rigid and quieter. it's downright dangerous as you find yourself having a hard time just pulling yourself out of the seat at the showroom, let alone de-scrambling your brain's idea of ""normal"" after a test-drive. :p"

can't wait to see the interior of the new b9 audi/s4/audi/sq5 line -- hopefully it will not have the stooopid pop up nav/info screen seen in the audi and audi lines. but, something tells me it will. 

darn things look so 1980's aftermarket to me -- i like the integrated look. the porsche macan has the dashboard look i would prefer -- but someone, somewhere has decreed the pop-up screens to be coool, i guess.


beer was indeed cold, and the grinders were indeed good. can't ask for much more than that. sat outside looking at the audis come and go. 

saw lots of car come and go (grinders parking lot must be a dealer ""turnaround point"") with dealer tags stuck haphazardly to their rears...mostly chevies, caddys, audis and mercedes-benz benz. dealers within a 3-4 mile radius of the grinder place.

-as big as the new chevrolet chevrolet is, it's a looker.
-cadillac must be doing well. we saw 4 of them turnaround with dealer tags....big and lit up like christmas
-saw one mercedes-benz benz cls (very sharp), 2 clas, and one c class that hooked like demos pulling in and out of the parking lot
-numerous a4s, a6s and whatever the small suv is that audi is selling pulling in and out of their dealer"
,,"back to the current and near-future of acuraÖ.the demise of the acura will take a sedan and wagon out of the lineup. will the acura, tlx and acura sedan and acura and acura crossovers be enough to keep the brand viable and return it to actual relevance? 

acura needs to fix the appearance of the tl. it doesn't really matter if it performs well and has a nice interior, it is still ugly. i'm driving my '05 tl at 132k miles and i can tell you that i haven't the slightest interest in the new tl. my vintage tl imho was one of the nicer looking car on the road and acura screwed up big time in going from very handsome to butt ugly (or beak-ugly). don't underestimate appearance, as few people want to invest that type of money and drive an ugly car.

then there's the acura - a car that went from sporty and handsome to not-as-ugly-as-the-tl, but bloated and not sharp handling any more. so acura blew it on two of their top vehicles. that's a pretty sad story for a lineup that was a lot better 7 years ago than today.

then again, buick is doing well with less- a compact sedan (verano), a sporty/performance-oriented mid-size sedan (buick) and near-full-size sedan (buick) along with a large crossover (buick) and mini-crossover (buick). in particular, the buick is a joke compared to the acura and the buick is no acura. but somehow, buick is more desirable than acura to most buyersÖ.

well, i'd say the buick are actually at least decent looking to attractive. like i said, don't underestimate the power of ugly to ruin a brand. buick is getting a lot better and acura has gone the other direction. while i would never buy a buick, i can see why they are improving relative to acura."
,,"""""alltorque"" might be right about the bmw 335""

,,"beware what you wish for. i love manual transmissions, all but one car i have had were mt, but imho if there is a case of at, it is small diesel engine. mt is least suitable for small diesel engines. short rev range of the engine turns the driving into constant shifting for shifting's sake. unlike modern gasoline engine (which is very flexible in both low and high rev range), diesel engine makes it really miserable on driver to be in a wrong gear. it either shakes the car violently (too high gear for the revs) or drops the torque of the cliff making passing or merging really scary if you need to execute 2-second gear upshift in the middle of the maneuver. on to of that, in honda driving you feel you end up shifing up and down on 5-10 mph speed differentials, so you don't those low vibrations from the engine compartment. how do i know all of that? i drove similarly sized and powered audi and peugeout 406, both with manual transmissions. both of those were considered one of the best diesel engines of their generations.

multigear automatic (like 8-speed) is absolutely transmission of choice for a diesel. imho, of course."
,,"i will mention, though, that the new cts is worlds better than anything mazda makes. it's positioned in europe as a bmw 5 series competitor at a lot less money. 

my parents just went through this exact same scenario. and had it down to the same models are you are looking at. and the cts just simply was a superior product to the infiniti. the only vehicle that gave it serious competition was the c300, which is my #1 pick if money is no object. it;s everything that you want and mercedes-benz benz is apparently finally making their car right again. though currently only the c class is benefiting, as will the upcoming model e class(it takes time to re-tool and phase in new technology)

also, i mentioned the pontiac because while 2009 was the last year for it, it had the same suspension and engine as a cts. it's a worlds better choice than the buick and actually is fairly attractive by comparison(looks like a cross between the cts and the buick, imo - slightly rounded but not a jellybean.

but let's look at the math on slightly used vs lease:
first off, infiniti has no financing options currently on 2011 models. (it's impossible to find a 2010 to lease at this point). fail.
let's look at acura, then. oops. same deal.
k... mercedes-benz benz. mercedes-benz benz always runs leases(as does volkswagen and audi) 

c300 $349/month for 27 months. 10k/yr. $3141at signing.
total at lease end: 12215 in payments. $452.41/month.
(a bmw bmw is $439/month with 0 down at signing for reference)

let's have some fun, then. 
2011 honda ex. $229 /month for 36 months. $1499 at signing. 
total at lease end: 9743 in payments. $270.64/month.

now why would i do this comparison? because to lease any vehicle, you have to factor in what it costs versus a used model that still has the same amount of factory warranty left. 36 months lease vs 36 months(or more) warranty. now, the main deal here is the drive train, which is pretty much all that matters(most certified car get an extension anyways and the gremlins have been worked out/fixed. it's basically a wash, imo, since a 2 year old car won't break anyways unless it's something nasty like a suzuki or daewoo. 

i did a 2 minute search for a 2009 pontiac with low mileage and under $25k.
http://www.autotrader.com/fyc/vdp.jsp?ct=c&car_id=279792030

figure $22k now and $12k in three years. that's $10k for three years. i put the honda in as a comparison because what this means is that you can get a certified year old vehicle and run it for three years for the same price as an economy car lease.

but there's no wear and tear adjustment, no money factor idiocy or other tricks, no mileage cap or penalty. in short, you can own and decide to keep to trade whenever you want for the same price as a lease. the only difference is the payment structure per month. but a 72 month payment plan will usually net (now due to silly low interest rates) about the same monthly payment as a lease. if you want out of it, or to buy it at the end of the ""payments"", it's a clear win. keep paying the bank or just sell it and end up with 0 month owed after 36 months.

i get about $350 a month in this scenario vs $450 a month for the mercedes-benz benz or bmw. 

note - you can get a 2008 cts for about ~25k and the money works out the same as the cts depreciates a bit less - ~15k at 6 years old. the only difference is $400 a month and the same $10k total cost.

let some other person eat the 10-15k initial depreciation. never buy new."
,,"there is no way tl will go. acura is definitely the one, if something goes. i think the us market is just too small and too tough to support car like that. it probably costs them too much vs. what they can charge in volumes those things are selling. i actually like it, but i know when i like something, it won't sell. acura being based on economy car spreads the costs much better. 

the problem i cannot see how in the world they could make anything close to acura experience with acura. the thing is based on honda platform :sick: whereas acura was based on euro/jdm honda, which were positioned similarly to us ellps (and sold at appropriate prices). so you know the pedigree of acura is much more noble than coming acura. this is just another example of acura and honda losing their way. they are undoubtedly going through some kind of crisis."

what i want isn't available, so i continue to tolerate what i can get. i presently drive an acura acura from the pre-beak era with a very nice manual transmission that drives the wrong set of wheels. it's been stone-reliable (well, there was the blower motor issue that i dealt with a month or so ago) for the whole time i've driven it (approaching 100k miles), but i've never forgiven acura for not bringing in the diesel acura that was promised for the model year following my purchase of the gasser that i drive. guess what -- they couldn't meet carb.
i drove my first modern diesel in europe 13 years ago and have been waiting ever since for the opportunity to buy one here. i'm getting older by the day. i don't think it'll ever happen. thanks, carb."
,,"i just saw that the honda president was either fired or resigned recently due to the airbag recalls, under reporting crash data, and a couple of other things. the article i read said he had navigated honda/acura through the global recession, the tsunami in japan (where a lot of vehicles were lost and manufacturing facilities were destroyed) as well as some other catastrophies.

i guess this means they don't really care what monumental obstacles you face, deliver to the bottom line or your gone.

personally, i think honda got away from what they did best with acura. that is, be a leader in engineering, performance, design, technology and value in the luxury vertical. acura (and the rl before that) hasn't been relevant for over a decade. as good as the tl is/was, it was not the most handsome car on the road. the new one is better. acura really didn't have an answer for the acura's demise. 

by default, they became a luxury suv company. it seems past those who view an cadillac as having ""made it"", the acura is the lux suv of choice with the upper middle class. i still like their products. whether it was because they never did recover from the tsunami, they felt their brand would be better served by moving more towards the middle of the market, or whether they lost their desire to lead, they seem to just be missing the mark with their car. i hope they continue to fire products at the segment because it's hard to find car that are as well built, drive so nicely, are as bulletproof reliable, and are good values as my acuras were. unfortunately, that's not enough these days."
,,"after a terrible experience with acura customer service re my tl transmission failing, i sold my tl for salvage.

acura offerred to pay $500 out of $5100 for a new tranny. what a joke.

i wrote them last week and said they could instead send me a check for $500 and i would not be so disgruntled. after an ingrid said she would try to accomodate this request, she phoned me today and so they would not issue me a check for $500. shows that they just escalated the tranny price.

smooth move acura. i would have bought my daughter a new honda last week but instead i bought her a new nissan.

my brother was considering an acura and he will buy either a lexus, infiniti, or nissan.

my other brother just bought a infiniti instead of a tl.

this $500 cost acura/honda 3 new car sales with more to come. unbelievable and incredibly short sighted."

yes, acura gives you more bang for the buck if you are a tech guy. but the acura is cheaper because it is built on a fwd honda honda chassis. a 3 series is built on a dedicated rwd platform which is more expensive to build & design.

same with the backup camera -- cheap to implement and very valuable.

i don't have the nappa leather in mine. i have the leather/synth suede stuff. it works...no complaints.

really find both the acura and the audi to be similar in materials and build, inside and out. paint? i have the ibis white. no metallic. the only s4 colors i've seen on the lots are my white, a metallic white (extra cost), black, metallic black (extra cost), a mid-level blue (extra cost). audi interiors are black or grey. not sure about the tl's colors these days. i know my sister's is metalic black. my former tl was something called ""bellanova white"" (metallic white). i don't remember paying more for the metallic, but acura may have changed their tune. don't know that i can say the paint job on one or the other is better. leather on my sister's tl is pretty darned nice. her seat are nicer (comfortable with good bolstering) than the ones in my s4 (hard and highly bolstered). she has full leather, i don't. shifter in the audi gets red hot in the summer sun (plastic). tl has a leather shifter....does not get hot. i do like the steering wheel of my s4 better. plus, the s4's dash and console area is prettier.

the electronics in the tl are much better than those in the s4 (which has been where most of my warranty work been). some mmi issues my dealer still can't figure out.

different car, different routes, different drivers, but i get about 19 mpg overall in my s4. my sister says she gets about 22 mpg overall in her tl sh awd.

the 3.7 in the tl sh awd is down on hp compared to the 3.7 in the infiniti. but, the acura has more torque than the infiniti.

i truly do wish my s4 spent less time at the dealer's shop. it is a pita. but, when it's on the road, it's a true joy to drive.

then again, so is the tl sh awd. bottom line, you can't go wrong with either as long as you go into it with open eyes.

tough call. your money. do what you want. let us know what you land on.

btw....my bmw dealer had a ""drive event"" a couple of weeks ago. at the s4's price, i'd throw in the bmw bmw into the mix. the f30s aren't as good as my previous e92, but they're still good car. at that $55k price point, you can get a pretty loaded up 335ix. a premium plus s4 with b&o and dsg will hit right about the same price range. plus, i believe bmw dealers are more willing to deal than audi dealers."

presumably, the s4 will be longer and wider, so perhaps the size, not the hp will mitigate and dilute the temptation to cross shop. or perhaps the rs3 will be priced out of reach compared to the s4. now, then, this makes me wonder if audi may think it needs a non-avant rs4 to go up against bmw and mercedes-benz benz high zoot models (now that the rs5 is gone).

if history is repeated, the new s4 will not take a breathtaking leap up in msrp, but will take more than an evolutionary leap in content and refinement.

so if anything, the 320 really is the entry level bmw to allow people that want one to get into ""the family"", same as the 323/325 did previously. it drives like a bmw, looks and feels like one, etc. so if anything, the purist's problem shouldn't be with the 320, it is the whole series."

so i stumble upon the cts yesterday and have been under the ether ever since! what a car...and over $30k less than a new xlr once all the options are added to it! i'd already have ordered one online had it not been for a few articles i've read about this mysterious ctc-coupe that might be coming out this summer. now i could certainly wait til august if that is indeed the case. no one seems to know for sure yet...maybe next month we'll find out for sure.

i just wish the xlr were a bit more reasonable. either way, looks like i'll be the proud new owner of some sort of cadillac here shortly! just found this forum and enjoy all the banter/exchange of info and opinions.

,,"i would assume audi and bmw (and merc, infiniti and lexus, too) will continue to offer v8's -- why not, they already have them and they are good, often great engines.

my point is more to the practical notion that ""what was once a v8 is now a 6"" (either i6 or v6) with a turbo, twin-turbo or super-dodge. likewise, we are increasingly seeing these companies moving from a 6 to a 4, also with forced induction.

these changes are being done for a variety of reasons, but the one that seems to get press, is they are using smaller ci engines (with forced induction) to improve the car's efficiency (without sacrificing performance.)

acura may well skirt the ""marketing need"" for more than 6 cylinders by taking the approach of further refining the current 3.7l and then breathing on it, one way or another, to get the hp and torque needed for a flagship vehicle.

when i was in germany i noted the d class car all over the place, but mostly with smaller engines (an audi with a v6? yep.) 

maybe acura will pull the covers off of a new ""honda"" v8 and put it in their flagship car (assuming they can muster, or, better said, want to invest in a complete re-do of the rl.)

at this point, i care not -- and i have no idea if i will get another acura.

i really like the tl in sh-awd advance trim -- but a lesser tl didn't do it for me; so who knows, maybe the next gen audi (b or c class) will draw me back. in other words, i was passionate about audi's, but i am much less inclined to be thus insofar as the tl is concerned.

the hell of it is, the acura tl sh-awd advance is ""more car"" a better performing car (gulp, please forgive me oh ingolstadt gods) and a more efficient car. add to that ""everybody"" says acura's are both reliable and durable (especially when compared with audi's, eh?) 

""everybody"" says so, anyway. 

but this claim, at least, is left to be seen. at 5,000 miles the acura feels ""new"" (actually better than new now that the engine is a bit looser); but, so did my last 10 audi's and my wife's last bmw (a 2008 x3 with all the toys on it.)

i would tell you my audi's were reliable (for 50,000 miles), but damn, out of warranty they were breathtakingly expensive to maintain and repair. i have only an opinion as to their durability, and, well, i assume audi's are simply not as durable as some other car, once the miles climb well above 50k.

so, will acura survive and thrive as an lps or ellps without a v8? beats the heck outta me -- customer's memories are short and most shoppers will probably be unaware of the lack of a v8 offering (if that is what happens) if there is a buttery smooth, powerful and quiet engine that responds to the touch of the accelerator. any of these companies is now capable of doing that with 4, 6, 8 or more cylinder engines.

acura needs, more than anything, to figure out what it wants to be when it grows up -- the current ""advance"" campaign is pretty good, but the entire product line needs a refresh and to keep and build a marketing campaign that imbues the brand with a positive image. currently, the image, if you asked me, is ""we're the bucky beaver brand"" -- with the exception, perhaps, of the zdx and who knows what the hell that thing is and who it is supposed to ""speak to.""

the current tl is a band-aid -- the upcoming generation of all of their vehicles needs to refine the styling cues across the board and update the technology offered.

hopefully the budget and the will to do this becomes evident.

in any case, i'm sticking with the ""who cares about offering a v8?"" theme for them.

toyota and avalons are great... at doing what they were designed for. i'd posit that they are better at their intended function, than most of the car in this discussion.

as an ellps, probably not that great. but, that's not what they are. 

95% of the buying public has no interest or need for an ellps. they need reliable, comfortable, efficient transportation. the toyota and toyota are great at that.

don't see how that has an effect on how great your ellps might be. maybe it's the 95% of people that you have a problem with, not the car companies that give them exactly what they want and need.
counter-counterpoint:

with a smile on my face and malice toward none, this seems somewhat of an apology on behalf of toyota. my point and question is why not build a great car at every price point. i do think the toyota is probably a good car -- and, as someone says (not just someone but voltaire, born in 1694) -- ""good is the enemy of great."" 

i would agree with something here -- ""95% of the buying public has no . . . need for an ellps."" their interest level is harder to ascertain, but, assuming you are correct that 95% have no interest, i would be made both sad and fearful. i assume you assume they -- the 95% -- have no interest because . . .um, they have never been exposed to greatness (at that particular price point)?

let me give you an irrelevant comparison -- while growing up, my mother fixed this nasty-tasting ""entree"" she called salmon patties. they looked like a cross between a hamburger and what, today, i think of as a mostly-crab, crab-cake. the taste, after frying was, well, horrible. but, hey, it's friday so well it was either fried smelt or salmon patties; so after a while i actually ate the salmon patties entirely. i don't think i ever liked them, but i did learn to tolerate them. eventually, in a sentimental, not logical or rational, moment i was told i actually said (i deny this) ""salmon patties are good."" perhaps, salmon patties are good compared to, er, hmm, dirt! 

time and tide, time and tide -- and i eat (in college) at a nice restaurant and the special of the day is salmon. first off, when it comes, i barely recognize it, and then when i taste it, i know for sure ""this sure as hell isn't salmon!"" salmon is great, i love salmon -- i had grown to accept canned salmon [allegedly] as good. 

how much is an toyota or a toyota? don't answer that, the point is not how much it costs it's that for that much money, it ought to be possible to build a great car, not just a good one that has a lot of stuff for the money. now, if the stuff is what actually makes it great -- and not the driving experience or its capabilities -- well, then i don't know what we're all talking about here. we could add navigation and blu-tooth to a trabant i would assume, but that wouldn't make it even a good car, it would still be a bad car that just happen to have sat-nav.

i don't think everyone needs or wants or should need or want an ellps -- i do think we all deserve to know what real salmon tastes like, so to speak. these super popular ['good' car] brands, toyota being the one i chose to exemplify my point, are just one of the contributors the great dumbing-down we're ""enjoying"" these days."

,,"car really have gotten overweight recently. amazing how heavy even some relatively small sedan are. heck, i think a volkswagen weighs over 3k now."
,,"ummm, i'm thinking that you've grossly misinterpreted what you quoted from wikipedia. true, most v6 engines use a three throw crank with some form of an offset between paired connecting rods to achieve an even 120 degree firing interval, however, even the 60 degree engines that use flying arms (an arm that reaches between connecting rods and extends from the throw back through the axis of the crank and some distance beyond) have no more complicated connecting rod assemblies than an inline engine. fwiw, flying arms are cast into the crank itself, they don't move independently and other than a little machining to remove a small amount of metal in the balancing process, require no extra work during engine assembly.

actually, when looked at from a part count perspective, v6 crank shaft, crank bearing, and connecting rod assemblies (bearings included) are actually simpler than an i6. why is that? simple, your typical v6 only uses four main bearings with a single 2-cylinder offset throw in between each main pair, however, your typical i6 uses seven main bearings with each cylinder having its own throw situated between main pairs. in spite of this difference, i6 engines usually have a considerably lower parts count compared to a v6 of an otherwise similar design.

all in all, not a bad car - as long as it's traveling in a straight line. but it doesn't like curves & it hates (if a car could be said to hate) anything that remotely approximates spirited cornering. in short, there is nothing entertaining about driving it. with 270 hp driving the front wheels through a 6-speed slushbox, it's more than powerful enough. but the steering is numb & only those who regularly use the words ""fun"" & ""torque steer"" in the same sentence will enjoy driving it.

,,"sweendogy - i give you a lot of credit for attending various driving schools. i also agree with you that if more people (not the guys here on the board), drove vehicles with manual transmissions that they'd pay more attention to their everyday driving habits. i used to heavily criticize many things on these boards many moons ago (i think i signed on in '99) from awd to automatic transmissions. 

automatics were terrible. my 1st car was a 1992 chevrolet beretta gt w/ a 3 speed automatic (garbage), my 2nd car was a 1998 ford ford sport with a 5 speed automatic that shifted slow & violently. 

i love my 2001 honda honda type sh equipped with a slick shifting, 5 speed manual transmission. i did not appreciate the bill i got to replace the clutch, friction plate, & throw out bearing at only 52,000 miles. 

my 328xi is an automatic w/ awd. it's our 2nd bmw with at & awd (1st was my wife's 2007 x3). manuals have been an $800 or so option for a number of years on the chevrolet. yes they are somewhat of a compromise, but that margin is getting slimmer & slimmer every year.

[ i am a torque addict. ] the 2.0l 4 cylinder [ highly boosted ] engine feels and sounds much smoother than the [ not nearly as highly boosted ] 2.0l in my 2013 volkswagen. sounds, and feels and pulls ‘expensive’. pulled cleanly and smoothly from low rpm and sounded eager to run all the way to the red line. i believe the c+d 12.9 sec. quarter mile result.

[ horsepower 292 @ 5,400–6,200 rpm

torque 280 lb-ft @ 1,900–5,300 rpm ]
the 6 speed dct is very responsive and the shifts, both up and down are accomplished very quickly and with no interruption in power flow. rpm match on downshifts is flawless. the paddles are active at all times, another of my requirements.
i spent several minutes looking over the interior, while my sales contact was on a call. everything = switchgear, surfaces, displays, etc. looked and felt of appropriately high quality. the seat were immediately comfortable and felt very supportive. they have the adjustable thigh support that i like. the front center armrest is adjustable up / down & fore / aft. a nice touch that i appreciate.
the handling, on several deserted curves, was quite confidence inspiring. no feel of front heavy weight distribution. the steering works well, for me. i was pleasantly surprised by the ride, given that this did not have the audi mag ride, nor the 19” wheels & tires than are required with that option. it handled the occasionally broken and deteriorating sections of asphalt and concrete pavement i encountered very well, indeed. this could save me $1,500!
overall, i was very impressed – and [ pending a longer test drive ] this has been added to my ‘short list’ of possible next car to purchase or lease. that list includes the bmw m235i.

,,"i hear you edward. put in other words, awd makes sport driving easier and more enjoyable for you because it takes some of the negative ""work"" (understeer, torque steer, etc.) out of it.

i don't have a lot of time behind the wheel of awd sports car, but i've participated in plenty of de's with evo's and sti's on the track, and they are fast - so fast that my bmw can't keep up with them. speaking to owners though, i've also heard that they are ""too easy"" to drive, and not much fun.

a fwd sport sedan can be very fun and satisfying once you figure out the ""magic"" of driving them properly - brake later on corner entry, trail brake deeper into the corner, turn sharper to a later apex, and straighten the wheel for track out sooner so you can get on the gas. it's a different line than conventional rwd, but once you master it, it can be just as quick as a ""rwd line"" - though i admit, it's not as much fun.

i suspect the audi audi gives the driver a very planted and confidence inspiring feeling - and it feels good to push a car hard and get that unflappable ""is that all you've got?"" response. i hear where you're coming from, but for me (and a few others here, i enjoy having limits that are attainable (and exceedable). i want to get sideways, have a ""dialogue with the pavement through the tires, and be able to control/induce understeer, 4-wheel drift, and oversteer with gentle finessing of the throttle and steering wheel. it's not going to happen on a car with multiple differentials that automatically transfer torque in varying amounts to all four wheels."

perhaps in addition to being confused by my friend's decision to go with the thing he thinks is inferior to the bmw (or whatever) he really wants, i am made somewhat sad that he -- a very close friend -- seems to have such passion for something that is not the thing he will go ahead and spend on.

there is always somewhat of a tone, a lament, as he apparently rationalizes not going for the ""thing"" about which he waxes oh so poetic and is also very knowledgeable about. he cites chapter and verse the performance stats and specifications of this, that and the other porsche or bmw, etc, then apologizes for the kia. this is a very successful and well educated guy. perhaps it is that this behavior seems out of character.

he has no need to apologize -- to me at least -- for his decision. our friendship is not based upon his possessions -- and there is no way he could think that the case. had i the means and a spouse who would permit, i'd get him an bmw or 5 series for pity's sake and hopefully enjoy -- vicariously -- him drive it.

i guess a perspective could be that we all settle -- but i don't think that is the planet you are referring to. i do believe most people, most of the time, seek out and acquire the best ""things"" they can. 

if we all hyper-extended ourselves, we all could -- for a time -- live well beyond our means. i believe most of us with decent incomes and relatively to very good credit scores could ""score"" a $100,000 car. i assume, considering that most of us here are discussing car that have a median or even mean cost of $50,000+/-, we could ""get a $100k car done."" by that standard, i would have to concede i have settled. i don't live or think that way -- in the particular case of the car, every mile i drive in my car has, so far, been better than the last. i'm driving what i want to drive (not that i don't also have interest in something better).

actually, it was the emotional impact of my friend, rather than touting the virtues of his new kia, chose lamenting that it wasn't a bmw (5 series, as i recall). that's what got to me.

that mercedes-benz benz was the 2014 model right? i didn't think the 2015 c class is in the showrooms for another month or so? i can't keep track of all the model numbers anymore!

2014 model year. talking with some of my test drive compatriots who were interested in the mercedes-benz benz....all mentioned they were torn between the ""deals"" that can be had for a '14 c350 coupe and waiting for the c400, which won't have any deals working in its favor.
personally? that '14 c350 coupe is mighty sweet. i'd be tempted to get it instead of waiting.
i also learned that the c350 coupe is relatively hard to come by vs the much more common c250. that's kind of like the 428i being much easier to find than the 435i with bmw."
,,i don't recall ever noticing an acura. one of these days i might have to try one on for size.
,,"acceleration is due to torque, not horsepower. bmw torque is 255 lb-ft at 1250-4800 rpm, i.e. it gets maximum torque really fast and stays there for duration. ats 2.0 has 260 lb-ft at 1700-5500 rpm. so those figures are about even, ats higher horsepower is basically achieved by longer curve, i.e. you get benefit at screaming engine speeds. ats higher torque starts a little higher rpm, which could make a difference in those 0-60 tests and possibly rolling start. quarter mile and passing (40-60, 50-70 or similar) numbers are more important in real driving conditions - does anybody know those?
another factor would be energy efficiency of parts (internal friction) and load from electrical power devices. the more stuff the vehicle has, the more drain it will experience. aerodynamics is another thing, important at higher speeds, over 40 mph. all those factors would contribute to test numbers."

,,"the interior of the s4 with two options -- upgraded seat and the ""pinstripe suit"" dash trim is drop dead gorgeous.

drive an s4 with the dsg transmission; put the transmission into ""s"" and be treated to mind reading awe inspiring performance -- without the torque vectoring rear (sport) diff even.

feel -- or perhaps better said ""sense"" -- the car downshift as you slow, smoother than anyone could shift a stick and without any pause. there aren't enough o's in smoooth to describe this, it must be, begs to be driven. a deep well of torque awaits your command with zero lag -- whoosh, it is like upgrading your iphone 5 to the new operating system and watching your email client make the jump to light speed.

here is my regret -- the difference between the 2.0t and the 3.0t ""a"" and ""s"" 4 is a chasm a giant, deep and wide chasm. the audi needs to be offered with the 3.0t engine as it is offered in the audi 3.0t. also, for some price, the dsg transmission ought to be offered on the 2.0t, the milder 3.0t and the wilder 3.0t (as it is already there). 

were audi to offer the 8-speed tip and the 7-speed dsg across the board (of three engines), i would look forward to win after win after win for these sport ,sedan: the audi, the as4 and the s4. nice as the new is 350 f sport is, i would expect the as4 and with absolute certainly the s4 to be seeing the is's led's in its rearview mirror.

and, for the money -- in this league -- the s4 and the 335 would be competitive (with each other, at least). of course the is and even the ats can certainly be considered the value leaders; yet, the infiniti/s is already so highly subvented (and it is likely to remain thus until its issues are behind it) that even with its faults is an attractive alternative for those who want an upscale high content premium car.

a friend of mine used to say audi's are for the left-brainers and bmw's are for the right-brainers -- meaning that ""programmers"" drove audis and the vice-president of sales drove bmw. i think now the infiniti has become the ""programmers"" [geek squad] car and, well, these days ""everyone wants to be audi.""

treat yourself -- take a nice long test drive in a 2014 s4 with the dsg transmission -- you may be worthy. me? i'm still not worthy -- but i'm working on it.

,,"flightnurse said: show previous quotesgraphicguy said:it's too bad that infiniti has had troubles in the sales arena. they used to make some fairly appealing sport-luxury vehicles. now? not so much.

acura went through this 4 years ago. it seems they've righted the ship with the new tlx. 

but still, it's a tough row to hoe when you swing and miss with a product redesign.

the fact that they're still selling the previous g series speaks volumes about how the q 50 is doing. i test drove a infiniti a couple of times. not sure the objective they were trying to meet, but whatever it was, they missed badly.


i think acura still have problem, their two best sellers are the acura and acura, the acura is long in the tooth and really isn't competitive in the market (but the lease payments are lower then the competition) and the acura just got another refresh.. i liked acura better when they had the acura and acura. 
no disagreements with you or mark. test driving the infiniti, it was like they couldn't make up their mind whether they wanted it to be a sports sedan or a luxury sedan and ended up with neither.

acura is moving to the soft side like it seems every other alleged ellss (with the exception of audi and cadillac) is heading....soft. still, acura tlx is going to sell 45,000 tlxs in '15. is there enough of a delta between an honda and the tlx? not sure. drove a tlx. it drives differently from my wife's honda. enough to justify the price difference? i still like them. $45k at the tippy top end for a technologically rich, 6 cyl with awd and torque vectoring rear seems pretty compelling."
,,"if i'm not mistaken, the eagle rs-as that came on my car carried a ""v"" rating back in 2009. that said, i'll probably never be able to prove it one way or another as i was able to sell them within a week of having them yanked off of my car."
,,"the resale values/residuals for most luxury performance sedan are weak compared to something like a honda honda. as you all know, that sometimes makes getting a used one a good deal. sometimes it seems like for just a thousand or two more than an honda with the same years and mileage you can pick up a 320i, an audi, or a tlx. even new it seems like the lease incentives on some luxury sedan are so high they they are almost giving you for free the added quality, features, and performance of the luxury car. 

i've mentioned before that maybe the most interesting book on the auto industry i ever read is called ""car: a drama of the american workplace"" by mary walton, published in 1999. this book was not about a luxury car, but instead about the second generation ford, which ford was trying to push higher in the marketplace. anyway, one of the memorable things about it for me was that—not surprisingly—every single part on a car goes through a tough process of figuring out what the cost and therefore quality of the part can be. ford was trying to make the 1996 ford a car that people would buy without big rebates, and as it was first designed and for its first year they allowed a higher budget for the cost of various parts so they would feel nicer, and sometimes function better. when the 2nd gen ford flopped in the marketplace the project manager had to huddle with his designers and engineers and try to figure out in an almost brutal way how to take something like $1500 in costs out of the car, which involved getting cheaper parts here, there, and everywhere.

since i read that i've been even more aware than i was before of the quality of big and small things in a car. sitting in a rental hyundai hyundai, for instance, i could almost immediately tell that most parts did not get quite as good a budget/engineering detail as the honda honda i used to own. 

and now with my new tlx, i can tell that the amount spent on most parts is not surprisingly higher than for a honda. for instance, the steering wheel buttons and controls have a quality and size on the tlx that a honda just doesn't have. this is partially about aesthetics, but it also impacts function. the adaptive cruise controls etc. are easier and more intuitive to use in the acura when compared with my wife's new honda with its small and comparatively cheap butttons.

again, given the discounts and incentives that most luxury performance sedan need to move, it's almost like the customer is getting this added quality for very little cost—and in some cases almost for ""free."""
,,"i'd suggest you re-read the class action lawsuit b/c it does require them to replace the brakes and rotors on the opposite axle to the drive under warranty! since the g35 and infiniti in my case, was rwd, this covered the front brakes/rotors. i had them replaced and resurfaced for free at 10k, 20k, 30k, and 40k. thats four times! when the rear brakes/rotors started having troubles at 20k, was told by two separate infiniti stealers that, ""oh, the rear's were not covered under the class action suit b/c the vehicles were rwd!"" called infiniti headquarters who only confirmed what the stealers told me and despite all my problem with the fronts, even though i was still under warranty would do nothing to help pay for the rear brakes/rotors. 

yeah, great customer service! infiniti does not step up to the plate when it truly matters! that is why they are ranked at the bottom of the luxury customer service list by jd power! 

no matter what automaker, you shouldn't be having brake/rotor issues at those kind of low miles anyway if they are made and put together properly. what is sad is that infiniti could not step up to the plate until being legally forced to and actually had the nerve to tell 2003-2006 g35 and 2003-2006 fx owners that they had to pay out of pocket for brakes/rotors being shot at 7-10k miles as normal wear and tear!

we used to have a lot of nissan/infiniti in my family, like you did with honda/acura and none so far have gone back to infiniti and replaced them with acura's, lexus's, and bmw's."
,,"i would agree with the 2002 observation -- and even agree perhaps for a number of years after 2002; but we're just about at the end of 2014. my point? things have changed in 12 years. 

the 335, the s4 and some incarnation of the mercedes-benz benz c class are ellps car based on the places we could logically and appropriately place them.

and, while i am certain you could find ellps car all day long with ""about"" a $40k price tag, it does seem -- now -- that because there is both a stronger ""p"" and ""l""component in the acronym (than 10-12 years ago), that the price of entry has probably crept up to a more realistic level of $45k or more.

as i mentioned, i believe that because folks here on edmunds are er, more passionate, about car and they really do want both the p and the l, ""strippies"" of some of the ellps car are probably not what we're opining about here.

now, along comes the new ellps class, perhaps?

what [or, perhaps, where does it belong?] is an audi or more pointedly an s3? it/they, today, could possibly be argued as deserving a footnote or honorary inclusion into the ellps class. but perhaps with the 2016 current ellps models looming ""larger"" (perhaps somewhat literally) than today's and certainly larger (for the most part) than the audi (with its shorter wheelbase and girth), perhaps the entire current membership of the ellps family needs to be moved to a newly named forum vacating the ellps space thus allowing the audi, s3 and the soon to follow car from asia, europe and the us, to fill in as the new normal ellps car.

of course, if that happens, where does a bmw 3 or audi audi or volvo volvo or tlx, infiniti or, or, or, end up? a 3 series will not be welcome in the lps forum discussions -- will it? a 3 series is not a 5 series an audi is not an audi, and so forth.

the lines blur, they come into ford, they blur again; the car get bigger (almost univerally) every time a new generation is released. a 2014 3 series seems bigger, to me, than a 2003 5 series -- etc etc. so what was true in 2002 just doesn't carry on (my wayward son.)

what's between an ellps and an lps anyway? ppplps - popularly priced premium luxury performance sedan (or would that be the step below ellps?) or perhaps umlps - updwardly mobile luxury performance sedan? maybe nqqfblps - not quite qualified to be a full blown luxury performance sedan. no no, how 'bout illps in keeping with the ""e"" for entry -- we bump it up to: intermediate level luxury performance sedan, and we move the current ellps players into the illps class and move the up and coming ""jr ellps's"" of today into the void left by moving the current folks from ellps to illps and so on . . .

yeah, that's the ticket.

personally, i wouldn't spend $50k on any car in this segment. i suspect that the only people who do are lease customers."
,,"as someone who just recently purchased an s4, and chose the 6-speed manual over the dsg, i'll add that it was a difficult decision due to the dsg being so darned good. as others have pointed out, shifts are imperceptible, other than from an audible standpoint, which i liked. now, i haven't been the biggest fan of it in some of our other car (tt, audi), but i thought the particular application in the s4 was outstanding. 

at the end of the day, i made my decision based on ""one last go"" with the manual. i appreciate that audi still offers it on the outgoing model, and thought i'd take advantage of it. that was a significant reason why i don't have too much heartache over buying a model that i knew would be replaced in the short-term. 

i suspect the manual won't be offered on the new model. when the s3 isn't offered with it, and they just took it away from the r8, i can't imagine why audi would choose to offer it on the s4. 

in any case, if i were to upgrade to the new model in the future, i don't think the 8-speed tip would deter me. i've had similar transmissions in previous car (535, x3) and thought they were great."
,,"it seems that if someone really, really wants a stick shift they wouldn't let a little snow stop them. i've heard so many times that proper snows and traction control let rwd car compete heads up with an awd car with all seasons. now add to that scenario someone that likes to live a little dangerously in the first place and it seems like a pretty lame excuse blaming the car company.

,,"stickguy said:hack job. i liked it. well loaded. quick. handles and rides well. sounds like badge snobbery. 
maybe, but i although i can't speak to the acura (though the interior pics did make things looks less than luxurious), i can speak to the tlx with an extremely similar drive train; which i've test driven twice now.

i have to agree with her review for the most part though, and i'm a honda fan. i think acura is now overpriced, and/or underwhelming. the car feels slow, but maybe adequate, just not inspiring. the car handles nicely, but again, not inspiring. the interior is fine, but i remember preferring the acura's interior. i much preferred the tl-sh-awd models i test drove last year. for closer to $35k than $40k (sticker overpriced, but real deals were to be had), the tl shawd made a compelling case. for nearly the same money, the tlx does not imho. 

i would say the car does everything pretty well, but anytime you give the car a compliment, i feel you have to put a qualifier like ""pretty or fairly"" before the words ""good and well"". no significant glaring weaknesses, but no real strengths either. i probably should have insisted on test driving the 3.5 v6 the second time, but i can't get over that you get an even more flawed transmission than the already flawed but improved at least 8 speed in the tlx. 

i think i'd rather buy an honda sport model, and save/invest the money saved to buy a future true performance sedan."

i've never been in a ""base"" tl. so, i don't know how those stack up, technology wise. without a doubt, for an enthusiast, the sh awd with tech package is the way to go.

my sister has the advance package. her leather (milano?) is very nice.

mine is a '13, that my (then) gf bought when the '13s had hit the streets last spring. i'm sure the '14s are out by now, but not certain of that. it's a premium plus. it has the torque vectoring rear (as does the tl sh awd), dsg, keyless start. b&o is good. i don't think it trumps the els in the acura, though. plus, dealer still can't seem to get my ipod/iphone to work consistently with it.

it was a ~$55k sticker. iirc, purchase price was right around $52k and change....give or take.

they put me in nice car to drive while it's in the shop. do i still like it?

yeah....it's a great car to drive. is it worth the $12k-$15k premium over the tl sh awd tech? i can't make that case. the acura is really good, too.

will i buy another one? probably not. i'll hold onto this one for another 18-24 mos. that will take it to near the end of the warranty period. based on current experiences, i don't want to own it after the warranty has expired.

,,"it -- perhaps superficially -- appears that cadillac is emulating the sony approach. sony, a few short decades ago was the big buck tv (and later there were many other sony branded electronics). back in the day when big name department stores would sell tvs, a shopper could be in selection mode and see a sea of zenith, rca, admiral and even mitsubishi tvs -- often the sony family of tvs was separated from the other brands; and, always the sony brand in whatever size you were shopping for was more expensive. time passed. sony proliferated the brand and began lowering prices. or did the competition creep their prices upward?

eventually sony showed up in walmart along side other ""perceived lesser"" brands -- regardless of the price erosion, sony did keep the image of being the premium brand.

lexus, on the other hand, produced a premium automobile, said to be comparable to mercedes-benz benz, and charged 20% less. over time, lexus was able to inflate the msrp of the car to near parity with the premium germans.

two approaches -- both appear to work to carve out market share.

cadillac seems to be working the sony model -- price the product more dearly, take the chance that the market will perceive the brand in an increasingly positive light -- ""cadillac is back."" this is time consuming, expensive and probably will work ""if"" there is sufficient shareholder and executive management patience to ""not quit before the miracle.""

the lexus -- land grab -- approach also has its merits. in a b2c model, i would assume the lexus approach seems ""intuitively"" to be lower risk. but, the brand will take a period of time to build up the desired perception. again, corporate and shareholder patience will be required, but since there will be volume, shareholders may think the ""miracle"" is closer than it may ultimately prove to have been.

you can't enact either approach if your masters fire you though. 

the investors -- a somewhat different group than the shareholders -- probably prefer raising prices, since the brand's equity (if the approach works) will certainly be built up.

oddly, in my perception, audi took the lexus approach (sort of), but i could argue the ""unintended acceleration"" situation that befell audi after the 60-minutes story, forced audi to discount their car just to remain relevant in the us (remember the days when select prospects received a $5,000 check that could be applied to the audi 5000 (which became the audi) linup. the approach would seem to be that the msrp was not discounted, but you were given an up-front rebate.

so cadillac is taking the approach of selling car that are priced higher -- the sony approach to market share, sort of.

of course the dealer body has to be convinced along with the customers that this is a long game and worth playing. the dealers, so it appears, are not exactly warming to this approach, however.

what happens when you like driving your new car too much? in just five weeks of ownership i've put c.3300 miles on it on my newly leased tlx tech. i love the handling, the stereo, the engine, the transmission, the seat, etc. and so i've been going on lots of fun trips to see old friends, driven to sites in town i haven't seen, and i've also been driving to cities i've never before visited. since i'm a prof. (which perhaps explains a few things) once the school year starts in a couple of weeks i won't be driving so much since i'll be working all the time. so that should slow down the miles, and then i'll also probably start driving my wife's new honda sometimes when going back and forth to lexington. 

but yikes....
what classes do you teach? i wonder if the standard audio in the tlx is better than the current honda honda+ models. i do wish the standard tlx came with leather instead of faux leather. the higher seating position in the tlx, similar to my honda is a plus. i don't like the lower seating stance of the new honda."

i will say that when i had my 911, my acura tl was more enjoyable to drive then. i didn't feel like it needed to go beyond it's capabilities to be satisfying. it's a damn nice, economical to own, sporty sedan; if not an all out ""performance sedan"". and i could let the guy next to me in his 550i rev his engine without feeling inferior - knowing that i had a car in the garage that could run circles around it. now the only other gas powered things in my garage are a lawnmower, nissan blower and chainsaw. although i have to admit, the chainsaw fills a bit of my need to be manly, at a considerably lower cost than the 911 did.

,,"benjaminh said:the resale values/residuals for most luxury performance sedan are weak compared to something like a honda honda. as you all know, that sometimes makes getting a used one a good deal. sometimes it seems like for just a thousand or two more than an honda with the same years and mileage you can pick up a 320i, an audi, or a tlx. even new it seems like the lease incentives on some luxury sedan are so high they they are almost giving you for free the added quality, features, and performance of the luxury car. 

i've mentioned before that maybe the most interesting book on the auto industry i ever read is called ""car: a drama of the american workplace"" by mary walton, published in 1999. this book was not about a luxury car, but instead about the second generation ford, which ford was trying to push higher in the marketplace. anyway, one of the memorable things about it for me was that—not surprisingly—every single part on a car goes through a tough process of figuring out what the cost and therefore quality of the part can be. ford was trying to make the 1996 ford a car that people would buy without big rebates, and as it was first designed and for its first year they allowed a higher budget for the cost of various parts so they would feel nicer, and sometimes function better. when the 2nd gen ford flopped in the marketplace the project manager had to huddle with his designers and engineers and try to figure out in an almost brutal way how to take something like $1500 in costs out of the car, which involved getting cheaper parts here, there, and everywhere.

since i read that i've been even more aware than i was before of the quality of big and small things in a car. sitting in a rental hyundai hyundai, for instance, i could almost immediately tell that most parts did not get quite as good a budget/engineering detail as the honda honda i used to own. 

and now with my new tlx, i can tell that the amount spent on most parts is not surprisingly higher than for a honda. for instance, the steering wheel buttons and controls have a quality and size on the tlx that a honda just doesn't have. this is partially about aesthetics, but it also impacts function. the adaptive cruise controls etc. are easier and more intuitive to use in the acura when compared with my wife's new honda with its small and comparatively cheap butttons.

again, given the discounts and incentives that most luxury performance sedan need to move, it's almost like the customer is getting this added quality for very little cost—and in some cases almost for ""free.""

volkswagen's problem was they alienated their old customers, but initially gained some ground on their cheaper and dumbed down models, but ran out of steam. my guess is people figured out that if you want a toyota clone, better get the original. to me volkswagen is a cautionary tale to bmw. you may have an early success, such as a new volkswagen and volkswagen had, but this doesn't guarantee long run.

i'm fortunate in that respect. i never would have ordered the $2,400 sport exhaust option in a 911, but since the car i bought had it and it was lost in the $10k discount, i have it. press that sport button and the car suddenly goes from reservedly quiet to the pleasant gurgle of a real porsche. almost back to the level of the 993 air cooled ones.

there's always the debate about how much value there is in bmw's including scheduled maintenance as part of the car's price. now i don't have the receipts in front of me, so i'm going from memory here. i planned on keeping my former acura for the long haul. in the almost 50,000 miles i owned it, i changed the oil (full synthetic) 5 times. every time i brought the car in for an oil change, i had the dealer rotate the tires. there's $500 right there. i also had to have the rear brakes replaced at 33,000 miles. i was partially reimbursed for this via a class action law suit settlement. i had to have the front rotors resurfaced. now im a pretty educated car guy and know that most of the ""major services"" that are ""recommended"" are unnecessary, but they aren't cheap. i wonder how many people walk into the deslership's service department and tell them that the car calls for a b1 service and get charged $250 - $300 for what amounts to nothing more than a visual check and an oil change."

denysschen has warned general motors management, cadillac dealers and the media that building the brand's prestige will take a combination of expanding the number of models, being more disciplined in pricing them and upgrading customers' experience in the showroom and service departments to equal or beat all competitors.

he also said dealers will be measured on how well they accomplish those last two objectives. cadillac has 928 dealers in the u.s. who sold 165,000 vehicles last year, compared with 282 audi dealers who sold 182,000 car, or less than one-third as many dealers.

""the reality, particularly in the u.s. is that the quality of the cadillac dealer network does significantly trail that of our competitors,"" denysschen said.

,,"yep, all tl sh-awd advance car came from the factory shod with 19"" wheels and tires -- the tires, are v rated, which is a good thing; however, my 2012 really was transformed when i upgraded to uhp a/s tires.

full disclosure, my advance wheels were bent from the get-go, and acura decided that they would pay only 50% of the cost of the new wheels since they weren't ""discovered"" as bent until 20k miles (i first complained at the first oil change which was just south of 8,000 miles, but acura thought i had warped brake rotors, not bent wheels -- so i was given the opportunity to buy factory oe wheels [19""] at the bargain basement price of $650-ish per.)

but i digress -- yes yes yes, the tl sh-awd advance comes with both sport tuned suspension bits and 19"" high performance rubber. 

i did like my tl -- but i love my s4. hopefully i will be the beneficiary of audis new consumer reports reliability rating of #4 most reliable car and #1 most reliable european car.

btw, the volvo volvo t6 type-r is in the msrp range of the above noted acura tl sh-awd advance. however, where acura will discount the poop out of the tl, volvo will give perhaps 3 or 4% off (if it is at the end of the month). the trouble with volvo is they never seem to have any car in stock that pulls it all together.

but wait -- the volvo european delivery program is one of the best of any manufacturer -- get the dvd that 'splains it. that might make paying closer to sticker a bit more palatable; and if you get the t6 type-r polestar edition, you can drive the thing on the autobahn if you stay a couple of extra days, then turn it back in at one of the drop off points and fly business class back to the states!

if you've ever driven a fine european car on the autobahn, you know what i mean when i say it should be on everyone (who loves car) bucket list.

the torque steer is something to overcome in the volvo volvo t6 (type r) but it is tough to get this car over $50,000. it may not do it for you due to the obvious fwd bias, but it is worth a test-drive if you're in the market at this dollar amount.
so, while $55k won't get us into the supercar realm, we do have a number of choices that will stay under this price cap. it's a great time to be in the market (the $50k+ market) if you ax' me.

my experiences with audi have all been positive. every company can have a bad apple. the real goal should be to buy a vehicle that never gives a company a chance to establish their customer service levels, as you never have to visit them. that's what happened my first 4,100 miles in the perfect 2014 s4, but a day before i'm supposed to pick it up at the body shop, i'm told the dealer is finding the left front side of the vehicle out of alignment spec, enough out of spec that they can't adjust to meet spec.
the accident was on the right side; this could spell trouble. not audi's fault of course, the lexus driver is at fault. i will say i escaped the ordeal without as little as a bruise; the belt did what it's supposed to do. i'm told the tow truck could have caused the suspension damage.
all the fluids had to be refilled & recharged (coolant, transmission, transmission coolant, ac system). the driver's seat belt has to be replaced (one-time use with significant impacts). the air box had to be replaced. might end up being more than 17k when all is said and done; i think they should have totaled it; we'll see."

by the way, i always enjoy looking back in my old kelly blue book as to what those car actually cost at the time. the lexus and infiniti came out in 1990, but giving them a year to ""establish"" themselves, here are the comparisons from the 1991 model year:

lexus ls 400: $41,650 / 110"" wheelbase
infiniti q45: $40,385 / 113"" wheelbase
mercedes-benz benz e300: $47,550 / 110"" wheelbase

mercedes-benz benz s560: $76,750 / 121"" wheelbase
bmw bmw: $43,600 / 108"" wheelbase
bmw 735i: $56,500 / 116"" wheelbase

so the lexus and the infiniti were sized between the 5/e and 7/s classes, but priced below the 5/e.

what is really interesting is how little mercedes-benz benz and bmw prices have increased since 1991. their ""fat days"" came to an end after lexus, infiniti and acura came to the us - and today bmw's and mercedes-benz benz are certainly not exclusively the territory of vp's and above on the corporate ladder. heck 16 years ago a 1992 mercedes-benz benz sl500 roadster had an msrp of $100k. more than a 2008 porsche 911s cabriolet! and more than a 2008 sl550!"
,,"flight, 

you conveniently avoided my previous post with an excerpt from dinan's own website that forewarned that, essentially, there is no free lunch and ""reflashing"" will result in greater engine stress and wear. go back to my previous post for the direct quote or read through their homepage. 

and dinan's willingness to match bmw's 4/50 engine warranty is not much consolation when modern engines should easily last 150k+ miles. hell, i could probably do fine over the next month or two having a 5 hour energy drink for breakfast, lunch and dinner. but i don't think that would be a wise long term solution to just eating right and getting exercise. 

i don't know the percentage of daily driving bmw buyers that go to their local dinan store for a pick me up to try to turn their 328's into 335's and their 335's into bmw's. but my guess is the percentage can be counted using less than the fingers on one hand - and a thumb isn't a finger. i do know that the resale value of an everyday bmw that has had the ""reflash"" or other engine modifications is significantly reduced. and i suspect that it's not permitted in a lease. it certainly will never qualify for a bmw cpo warranty.

so the idea of reflashing a 320 might be an option for you and a handful of your buddies, but that's really not comparing factory apples to factory apples for 96%+ of the market. maybe 99%."
,,"if you want 320 without maintenance, make sure you don't get sports line. its summer tires will go at 20-25k, other lines have all-seasons, which may last the whole lease, but they may go around 30k-35k, just before you turn it it. you may get away with skipping alignment for three years, i guess, especially if you don't need to change tires before the lease is up.

the point is--are you driving or are you steering? 
might be relevant if you are driving flat out on a track. in normal driving, even the rare spirited back road type, i bet most people (including me) don't push the envelope to that extreme, so the fraction of a second difference is meaningless. but the tactile experience and sense of control isn't. ats are imo much more likely to spend time trying to hold a much too high gear, or hunting around for the right one, than they are to be snapping off powershifts at the redline. 

they are more relaxing in stop and go traffic though. not that lightning quick gear changes matter much in that use!
lighting quick gear changes probably help contribute to the superior fuel economy though."

,,"news: audi b9 coming -- but not exactly soon . . .

2016 audi/s4 will be unchanged from the 2015 model, which was unchanged from the 2014 which was unchanged from the 2013.

the audi as we know it now will enjoy a short model year (sort of).

the b9 audi sales training (us) is scheduled for november with 2017 model car arriving at dealers approximately in february of 2016.

my buddy at the audi connection here in cincinnati showed me the email ""from corporate.""

the discounts on the 2016's will be, one would imagine, compelling -- how else will they be able to sell 'em?

having said the above, the audi, even ""long in the tooth"" is a great place to spend miles and miles in. the s4 even more so -- with a bunch of incentives (my guess is the price will include a bunch of 'packages' in the premium+ versions -- standard nav, standard b&o, etc -- so for your $45k you may drive off in a $52k s4, which would be a helluva deal.)

or perhaps for your $39k, you'll drive off in an all singing, all dancing loaded audi.

there will be those among you, however, that just won't be able to take the leap knowing that in some very few months later, the new and improved model will be for sale, meanwhile you've still got 42 months to go on your lease or note.

decisions, decisions.

it's probably one of the best guaranteed rate of return in zero-interest environment (adjusted for risk, of course). it of course is not a real rate of return, just savings in interest charges (or their equivalents in lease).

the strong dollar does make exporting the polo cheaper but would it be cheap enough? what happens when the dollar weakens and then volkswagen is losing money on every polo imported from spain? perhaps if the next polo (mk vii) moves onto the mqb platform, then it can be made in the us or mexico and be profitable. 
i would have no problem paying a somewhat premium for a teutonic (and it doesn't even have to be made in germany) driving vehicle with a really nice interior - you know, like the early 2000's volkswagen and volkswagen. what i'm tired of (and i owned a volkswagen in the late '80) is the ultra high cost of parts and even more so the poor dealer service network and poor reliability. high parts cost is ok if the experience of the car is good and they are reliable. so i really liked the late '90's/early 2000's volkswagen and nearly bought a volkswagen as it was much like my '90 audi audi - just a bit bigger but still almost as nice in size - practially an ellps. fast forward to the later 200x's and the volkswagen is bigger, relatively cheaper, and softer. it's more like an american car but still poor reliability, expensive parts, and volkswagen service network. that imho is why volkswagen has missed the boat. and also agree that they are slow to respond."

quality is a lot better in the lexus. forget the big items as the small stuff makes for greater frustration. i always had a few things in the audi that needed to get addressed every service (broken small pieces, peeling of plastic coating, etc), but not with the lexus. the lexus is put together great. i know why they have loyalty because there are so few complaints on the small annoying things as the car ages. i guess that is why there are a lot of last gen lexus driving around that people love. service varies, but around south florida, the lexus experience is top shelf (better than audi). i almost never have a list of little things to be addressed at the service intervals.

the audi feels sportier and has a roughness that reinforces that. the lexus is serene and the quietness/plushness reinforces that. both get old at times, but you have to decide your preference. 

i can't compare engines as my audi cab was heavy and did not perform any better than the is250. i get great gas mileage and do not want any more hp in my car given fuel prices. with prices expected to hit $4.50 by end of july (premium - see record oil prices today and stock market plunge) i wouldn't mind giving up even more hp for even better gas mileage. 

the audi is more versatile, but can't touch the lexus for overall luxury. plus, the lexus v6 is smooth and does have plenty of umph when needed. i loved the audi and await the audi convertible, but unless you carry a lot of things that you need the audi for space - i think the lexus is the better choice. i was not inclined to keep the audi out of warranty, but will not hesitate to keep the lexus based on my personal experience."

i would think if, to use made up but approximate numbers, that an audi audi or bmw 3 (something) can be ""nicely contented,"" which i suspect means, these days, premium package, premium paint (and infiniti doesn't, currently, charge for any color they offer), nav package, and sport package or technology package (but not both) for something between $45k and $49k -- depending on the ""either or"" packages and metallic paint, bla bla bla, that infiniti would be -- even with this new presumably sexy infiniti -- hard pressed to come in at parity with the germans.

i mean, really, my last audi (a 2009) was $49k -- for $49k i'm going to stick with the german car. i wouldn't pay $49k for the g (or the new q -- at least not until it is vetted by you all here on edmunds and the motoring press, etc.)

i would think the infiniti will have to be very nicely equipped (meaning all the bells and whistles infiniti can offer -- but not the hybrid version) and a few grand less to win, to conquer the pro german buyers.

i leased my current acura tl sh-awd advance only because it was much less than a 2012 audi comparably equipped and a hell of a lot less than an s4 which the tl somewhat ""imitiates.""

i'll scope out a new audi, bmw and probably c class. then i will do my best ""objective"" comparison with and without a consideration of price.

if the infiniti turns out to be bmw-like and is hundreds less per month in payments or thousands less in msrp (and/or street price) and is either contented at or greater than the bmw, i'll very probably give the infiniti serious consideration. 

if the infiniti is close to the ""cost"" of the german rivals -- with even somewhat close content, the german is with very high certainty going to be the chosen one.

i could be wrong -- but, not uncertain, of course -- and perhaps the new ex-audi alum, infiniti ceo will want to pump up the infiniti's msrp to achieve parity with the german ""b"" segment from the get-go.

my logic, hopefully not specious, is that the infiniti infiniti no matter how much it is called the japanese bmw will not be able to command bmw prices until such time -- if ever -- that people start calling the bmw, ""the german infiniti.""

,,"my 2009 audi has a build date of week 27. when it arrives several weeks later, it will be my 28th (or 27th or 29th) audi. i have never had an electrical problem -- other than a power window motor some time ago. i have never had an engine problem, never a transmission problem (other than the crappy tip-lag issue in the 5 speed auto -- and that was a software issue not a defect or hardware problem.)

i may have had a headlight or tail light burn out last buick. i also had brake rotor warping issues in my 2001 audi.

my experience with over 2 dozen audis is, statistically, probably not significant, but as an anecdote, it bears writing here perhaps to balance the ""audi still has problem. . ."" overall, i have no evidence that audi still has problem. my '05 audi, soon to be gone, will be missed. in so many ways it is still ahead, by years, of the newest cts -- if you could test drive these two car back to back, the content and performance of the c6/audi vs the cts demonstrates this point. the amount of trouble with dozens of audis has not been zero. it just has never been electrical as your post suggests.

,,"markcincinnati said:dino - i guess i should add, too, that i don't actually know that the japanese lps brands have previously been humbled, either -- but i think (my opinion) they have, or at least they should be since they so frequently are not the winner in comparos in the big, important car magazines.

i saw motorweek on tv this week and the lexus gs was tested (not compared), things went along nicely as the car was shown on the track and street -- and then wham! john davis pretty much put the car in its place (which was to say, it was not at the top of the premium car heap, based on comments about handling, braking, etc),

yet, ""everyone"" i know who has a lexus loves them -- of course whenever i ask why, the reason, the reason, the #1 reason, the only reason i can ever get out of them, is either how reliable or durable they are. 

odd, methinks, how i can't ever seem to elicit a comment about a lexus, infiniti or acura that praises their performance, style, switchgear -- oh oh oh, i take it back, once, someone told me how good the sound system in his acura is (and speaking as a previous acura tl sh-awd advance owner, i agree -- acura has the best sound systems for mere mortals -- the only one that is better is the hyper expensive b&o option audi offers for $6,000+).

don't get me wrong, a sound system is very important in a car -- but, you know, when someone tells me about their 5 series or their new mercedes-benz benz e or c, they tell me about the performance, ergonomics, 8-speed or 7-speed transmission, engine, responsiveness, cornering, etc, etc, etc.

my wife thinks that her infiniti was great -- from a durability (and probably reliability) standpoint. but she ended up with an sq5 (audi) because ""infiniti's ain't got no soul."" she was against my getting a 2014 is 350 for the same reason -- told me, i'd be underwhelmed by it's appliance-like disposition.

i do appreciate, too, that i've read, here, the comments -- positive comments -- about the recent el and lps cadillac offerings. and, well, they are hardly known as durable car -- and no one i know who has one claims they got it thinking it would be the new world champion of longevity. ok, so here i am at age 63 -- i'm thinking i'm still gonna outlive any car i get, so i might as well get one that comes with passion, performance and pulchritude.

got one more data point for you: when i used to have the acura, i'd take it to the dealer for service and would talk to other customers about their reasons for being acura owners. now, get this -- the best answer i ever got was ""because i got a good deal."" meanwhile, over at the audi cafe (and the bmw store service area, too) the folks talk about how much fun their car are to drive.

imagine that.

oh, and, yes, i know, this proves nothing.
mark...if i wasn't known for flipping car every 2-3 years, i don't know that the cts would have made it to my garage.

that said, the last gm product i owned was a chevrolet chevrolet, which was well put together, uber reliable, and aside from fuel efficiency (which was at best, dismal) cheap to own and operate. but now, tahoes are a $65-$75k step down from $80k escalades, so, not sure i can say they're in any way shape or form, economical.

so, if i keep my cts long enough, perhaps i can really see if gm and cadillac have changed.

all that said, i mentioned a few months ago that i had tested an s3. suspension was way too stuff for my tastes (a whole other level stiffer than my previous s4). ran into one of the guys who originally helped me at the audi dealership on the east side of town. he recognized me immediately (probably because of all the time spent at his dealership trying to get audi to fix my car). it took me awhile to place him, but i knew him.

kind of funny because i think at the time he was the audi sales manager. he said he's doing something with one of the other dealerships in the dealer group. he was the only one who at least tried to get audi to swap me out of the troublesome s4, which they refused, preferringto irritate me even more and actually having to pay me to buy the car back. go figure.

anyway, he said he was starting at the dealer group's porsche store next week. he wasnted to know what i was driving (didn't denegrate his caddy competition saying he thought the cts was a good looking car). last day at audi is today. starts at porsche on monday.

i told him of my test drive of the s3 and that i found it way too stiff. he said he hears that a lot and blamed to high perforamnce summer tires. he said the dealership routinely swaps out the summer tires for high performance all weather tires, which makes a big difference on the ride.

he did have pics on his phone of a new s3 they have in stock that was gorgeous.....white metallic with black and grey leather interior. he said they just put all weather shoes on it and i should stop by for a test drive. he said he wanted to leave the audi store on a bang. 

told him i was still stinging from my last go round with audi. he didn't minimize my feelings stating he totally understood. but, he also said that was highly unusual.

,,"that said, $47k for a bmw is a ton of money. i can buy a bmw for less than that. 

yeah, but then you don't get a few things. my wagon was $46.5k msrp. it took sports, premium, convenience and nav. i guess you don't really need nav and half of the convenience (hid is a must, but keyless start or rear sunshades are not). i would not get one without premium and sports, if not just for seat. if those seat were sold separately, i'd get them and could live with all-season rubber, on standard rims., normal suspension and speed limit at 130 (although i got it to 138 mph on german autobahn, but well  ) 

what's funny is realization than when compared with sedan, the wagon is actually cheaper, even though it starts higher. sedan doesn't have standard fold down seat ($500, which is absolutely ridiculous - what's worse i noticed dealers actually don't order them - can only imagine surprise on somebody's face first time they try to fold seat :sick: ), is also has no sunroof (which i understand tall people may actually prefer not to have). what's more, the wagon's sunroof is ""panoramic"" (about half longer, because it can fold under longer roof) - absolutely awesome, puts  every time i reach for the button.

,,"i agree completely with your comments re:audi s4. i likened the tl sh-awd advance 6 speed auto to an s4, but it is s4-lite or s4-like -- i use those words, phrases in an attempt to offer up my impressions as a long-time audi owner (who has also had 3 bmw's). i don't think most folks would ever cross shop these two car.

i was looking for another audi prestige with sport package, etc, but i was also looking to keep the payments under $600 per month. couldn't do it with the content i wanted in the car. the audi prestige content and the tl sh-awd advance have similar content. the tl and audi have similar wheel bases and both are ""nice"" car -- with the nod going to the audi on all counts.

if i were forced to keep the tl for 5 more years, i think i could live with that, since the tl refuses to betray its mileage. by this time on my audi (20k miles) there were ""feelable"" signs of wear (not tear, just wear) -- which also goes for the 3 bmw's we had. the bmw dealer said to us that bmw's are higher performance machines and they are built to outperform their competition at the cost of needing to be fiddled with, adjusted and tweaked more than the other car that have lower tolerances and so forth.

this proved true with audis too -- even as they got better and better in terms of reliability. my experience is just another data point: german car, japanese car and i assume [hope] american car are all reliable (getting stranded in the wrong part of town just doesn't happen in a modern car like we're talking about.) what little disagreement we have or may have is that the german car seem to require ""lots of little adjustments"" to keep them feeling young -- the japanese car, on the other hand, ""feel"" (at 30,000 miles in the case of my wife's infiniti and at 20,000 miles in the case of my acura) unfazed by the passage of so many miles.

i'd take an s4 over virtually any of the car in this class -- if money wasn't an object. of course an s6 would be, for me, even better. i had an audi upgraded at the dealer to an s8 suspension that i had them order from germany -- now that was very nice. today, however, i'd still prefer the s6 over the s8 even if i were spending ""other people's money."" the s4 and especially the s6 seem to be great ""middle sized"" vehicles -- and both are fun to drive. i may have shared this before, but my 1995 s6 remains my favorite car of all times -- not the best car i ever had, just the one that recalls the fondest of fond memories."

one of the reasons i won't buy a cadillac was the way they treated my late mother. this was several years ago, but my mother had bought an sts brand new. granted, her only driving was to the hair dresser, the grocery store, the pharmacy, church on sunday....literally a car driven by a little old lady.
it may sit for a day or two, but it was driven at least 3-4 times/week. it kept draining the battery. cadillac dealer kept replacing the battery. a week or two after the new one was installed, it would go dead.
gm started doing the ""hokey-pokey"" with my mother...blaming her for not driving it enough. so, she and i swapped car. i drove her caddy every day. same thing happened when i drove it.
after having it towed yet again to the 3rd caddy dealer to see if they could fix it, they authorized a new battery as the ""fix"". i asked the service manager if it didn't make more sense to do a diagnostics on the electrical system to see why the battery was being drained. he said all gm would reimburse them for was a battery replacement.
gm ended up eating that car after there was such a huge surge in the electrical system that the rear window defroster actually ""blew out"" the rear window after the surge.
when the buy back was authorized, i took the caddy to the selling dealer as gm instructed. dropping off the keys to the gm of the dealership, he said he wished he had never sold the car to my mother.

i know it is an overused concept, but when a successful automaker deviates from their core dna, bad things will probably happen. in the case of bmw, the prevalent attitude is: ""want a bmw that drives like a bmw? it's gonna cost you!"" it's akin to hsu research or velodyne announcing, ""from now on, all of our subwoofers priced under $1,500 will sound no better than a bose acoustimass- but they will look just like our high quality subs. fork over another $1,000 if you want the sound to match the nameplate."""

but, if you are not in any situation that might require such an electronic intervention, why would turning the esp off be helpful? abs only comes into play when braking so hard that sliding tires are a possibility, but abs typically cannot be defeated (it is just always at attention, awaiting to be called upon). i would think esp causes no brake wear period if it is never engaged.

very well said q! right on the money!

dino - i know the ride, build quality (solidness), rwd handling balance are very different between your 328it & your subaru sti, but how are you holding up with the severe power differences between the 2 car.

q - i totally agree with you regarding the auction values of car, that's what you get from the dealer whether it is a 10/10 or a 7/10. they deduct more if the car is in rough shape and don't add so much if the car is truly exceptional.

sometimes, if you have the perfect car for the perfect buyer, things can work out in both of your favors. back in 1998, when we graduated college a friend of mine had to have a ford convertible with a stick. he special ordered a v6 (vee six) ford convertible with a stick. we tell him he's nuts because everyone who wants a ford with a stick shift is going to want a gt (v8) & he's going to have a lot of trouble selling the car when the time comes. 

to say my friend is anal about how he keeps his car is and understatement. he also made it look like a gt (dual exhaust, rear bumper to integrate dual exhaust, fake hood scoop...).

fast forward to 2003. he special orders a mini cooper s. his mini comes in and he starts looking into selling his faux gt v6 5 speed ford convertible. i do some research for him & tell him that given the way domestics depreciate & given his car is a complete odd ball to expect to get maybe $11k tops for the car.

he lists it himself anyway after getting trade in offer of like $10-$10,5 (plus paying full sticker for the mini). he gets a call from some 16 year old kid who wants a ford with a stick, but insurance (& his parents) prohibits him from buying a v8. he likes the stick, the convertible, (mom likes the v6), & most importantly the faux gt styling. i think my friend got $16k for his car."

the s4 would be high contented compared to the merc and the s4 would make the worthy opposition sweat.

me? again, i am looking for content and performance and bang for the buck. hate to say it, but the is 350 f-sport makes a compelling case (when compared to even the god-like s4). 

you know, all the criticism about infiniti and lexus bringing out new car with ""old"" engines does have merit. but, even so, the is 350 seems to win the pros over in spite of its ""old"" engine. i get sweaty palms just imagining what would happen if lexus told its engineers to make the requisite changes to the 350's powerplant to allow it to accept either a super or turbo dodge. :surprise:

if one is looking for a badge at a low price, 320 is their choice, no need to go higher. this leaves 328 for buyers who like those options, like better seat (sport/m-sport) and/or interior inlays (lux) and are able/not mind paying. i think over time the trend will be more pronounced as 320 replaces entry 328 trims. there will probably be fewer overall 328 in dealers inventories and their volumes will go down as a result of higher option levels."

,,"i knew what you meant to say and that was cute to me (assuming that is something is true in us, it must be universal), but let's not dwell on that. i meant to be funny, but i probably wasn't. the fact stays that united states is a world with by far cheapest car and energy, not just in terms of currency prices, but in terms of actual income percentage. it is also true about other items, such as certain electronics (iphone/ipad costs in europe about twice what it does here, even more in china). 

the reasons for that to be the case are plenty, from general output (i.e. us is still in fact either highest of almost highest gnp/capita), combined with scale (even small price break could bring marginally more sales, which can fuel more price breaks). however, the biggest difference lies in market fragmentation (combined europe is about us size, but each country has its own very separate ways and they don't interact in terms of retail) and more redistributive economy, i.e. higher taxation on all levels, from capital, to income, to consumption (e.g. euro sales tax, called vat is from 17 to 25%, euro income taxes are progressive reaching 50% and beyond on top bracket, euro social security taxes paid by employers as surcharge go into 30-50% territory, all depends on the country). there is also large amount of social engineering going on there as well, where ""undesirable behavior"" (such as owning large-displacement engine vehicle) is directly punished by the government through additional taxes and scrutiny. they also excert a direct pressure on manufacturers to make or not make certain products as well, a concept introduced to us just only recently. all this combines into really punitive taxes and high prices of ""unnecessary good"", which car, especially luxury ones are perceived as.

it gets even worse in poorer countries, almost inversely proportional to their wealth. explanation for that may be in volume: even if mb or bmw lowered the price, they would not sell more product, so prices remain high to pay for higher distribution cost of smaller markets and the circle closes."

i've had two audi's have their brakes replaced and i have the wear pattern progression of both my wife's sq5 and my s4. she has over 50k on hers and the dealer says she'll probably need new rear brakes in less than 10k miles from now. not sure what that means with respect to when the front brakes would need replacing.

audi suggests new rotors, on our bmw's the service dept said bmw prohibits a ""brake job"" from being carried out without also changing the rotors. on my 2005 audi, i had all four brakes (rotors included) replaced at around 48k miles at no charge under the audi advantage. that option, via the audi advantage, now is only free for the first 12k miles if i read the aa correctly.

bmw costs, thankfully covered, were a small four figure number for new brakes for a 2008 x3. whew, avoided that one.

audi prices, still breathtaking, seem to be lower, but it seems to me that the costs would be still at least 75% of the bmw costs (at the dealer). 

on my 2001 audi, i bought cross drilled rotors (not from the dealer) and took them to the dealer for installation.

i love the brakes on our audis -- and 50 to 60k for replacement doesn't seem horrible -- what does seem to be the case though is that the costs (using audi parts) do seem too high. yet, the brakes are one area that i am certainly not willing to go no-name brand installed at midas, or where ever.

personally, audi to me, has sales similar still to acura and infiniti in quantity but even audi is different from mb and bmw in that like the japanese, they have nicely priced trim levels that include a whole bunch of features so that you don't have to get really expensive option packages or pay extra for each luxury feature you want. but then again, you have the reliability factor with them so your right that there a huge set of factors, prestige being just one of them, to consider with each luxury automaker.

now then, the issue is what is the definition of normal maintenance?

my wife's last bmw (a 2008) could only have an oil change (that was free) when the car said it needed it -- once this was at 19,000 miles. since the car was leased, we changed the oil and did the other things when the book called for it. to me bmw's service recommendations aren't ""normal,"" since the miles between service intervals seems impossibly long.

audis want oil changes every 10k miles -- and there is no computer inside that is determining when the maintenance should really be performed. i would think that would make a used, late model, audi perhaps less prone to the wear that a bmw might have with its very very long service intervals.

i repeat, i have no clue how soon it will be -- in miles -- before you will notice your volvo isn't ""new"" anymore. 

i turned in my 2009 audi 2.0 with just under 55,000 miles on it -- it needed new tires (what would have been its third set) and the sport suspension seemed to be a bit ""worn"" feeling. also it used a quart of oil every 2,000 miles, which seemed excessive, although the dealer told me there was a tsb on it that essentially cured that issue.

of our 29 german car, only my 60,000 miles young 2005 audi 3.2 still felt ""young-ish"" after 30,000 miles. 

the difference in the german car is they drive like no other -- so what you get are car that ""die young and leave a good looking [driving] corpse.""

one more time, for the same money, i'd still take the german car even though i believe it will be breathtakingly expensive to keep young.

gee, don't remember saying anything like that. but to answer your question....of course not. 

""suvs became popular in the united states, canada, india and australia in the 1990s and early-2000s. u.s. automakers could enjoy profit margins of $10,000 per suv, while losing a few hundred dollars on a compact car.[11] for example, the ford excursion could net the company $18,000, while they could not break even with the ford ford unless the buyer chose options,[12][13] leading detroit's big three automakers to ford on suvs over small car."" 

while this talks about ford, from everything i've read about margins online, in magazines and in the daily newspapers say the same thing re all automakers. suvs have much better margins than passenger car so selling a high proportion mix of suvs vs. passenger car should maintain profit margins. of course, good profit margins on all lines would be preferable. but the fact remains that your statement about acura having little to no profit was just one big assumption. good to see you finally admitted that your statement was basically an educated guess which is pretty much what any opinion is. some are just more educated than others."

what appears to happen with most of them is that the system transfers enough power to the rear wheels to merely keep the vehicle's place stable on the hill and does the climbing with the fronts alone. this works to a point.

dealers love ordered car -- i would bet, overall, that dealers would love to have only demo's in stock and have 50 or 60 car on order every month. 

as far as i know, this is the way it is done in germany (mostly). you research your car, you go to the dealer who has a demo -- if you like it you order it.

our sometimes heated discussions about the merits of manual transmissions vs. automatics or about rwd, fwd, awd, etc. are – or will pretty soon be – irrelevant. these discussions may be entertaining, they may even be cathartic, but there is plenty of evidence of the inevitability of semi-autonomous and ultimately autonomous car. 

with google, apple and many others you’ve never even heard of working on technologies whose purpose it is to remove you from the driving equation, it is a matter of years – perhaps so few we could discuss the time frame in months (you know like a 60 month car-loan term) – before we essentially have “individual” mass transportation. by that i mean we’ll have individual containers (car) that, as far as you’re concerned, provide you with about the same experience you have as when riding a bus, limo or train. you’ll have the flexibility that a private car offers and you’ll be, for the most part, nothing more than a passenger.

it probably doesn’t even matter if you want this technology or not, it’s coming. it’s coming pretty quickly too. insurance and many other private companies, federal, state and local governments want it. you’ve (or perhaps, better said, “we’ve”) proven we’re not capable, or perhaps it is just that we’re not willing to prevent the inevitable. just this morning, coming into work, i passed a driver of a late model mercedes-benz benz s class – the driver was on the phone! there is no way this mercedes-benz benz doesn’t come standard with hands-free, eyes-free, voice activated bluetooth connectivity and control; yet, there was this bozo with one hand on the road, in rush-hour traffic, with the phone held up to his ear. now, how does that make me make the leap to autonomous car?

well, as i am willing to say, i am often wrong, but never uncertain, we might simply mandate built in jammers that prevent cell phone usage in a moving car. but, think about it, what we really want is for the driver to not use a hand-held phone while driving. we probably don’t want to prohibit passengers from using a cell phone. even my audi offers in-car wi-fi, so it seems that we’re moving in the direction of greater, not restricted, connectivity. so what do “we” do? rather than taking away the ability for the driver to use a hand-held phone, we’ll just go ahead and take away the ability to drive the car altogether because we have demonstrated that distracted driving is sometimes actually worse than drunk driving – and if you bother to look, you’ll find there are a lot of drivers using hand-held phones. this is all the more frustrating (for me at least) since i know that an ever increasing number of car have bluetooth as standard equipment.

inevitable? yes. while growing up, my parent’s car never had seatbelts – in 1963 my dad bought a brand new chrysler newport. it did not come with seatbelts. the dealer, however, did put them in the car (2 in the front seat only). i never knew if this was in response to a government mandate or if it was part of a promotion. as time passed we graduated to car that came with 3 seatbelts in the front (unless you had bucket seat), then rear seatbelts, then shoulder belts then seatbelt interlocks that essentially attempted to force seatbelt use as the car would not start unless the seatbelts were fastened (leading to folks fastening their seatbelts, then sitting on them, therefore defeating the purpose.) 

we can, in the name of safety, list all of the inevitable features that have been added since 1963 – actually, we could have another list of all of the features added in the name of safety before 1963. these two lists, with descriptions, would fill volumes.

these days, any manufacturer who wants to, can crank out a 300hp motor and put it in a lightweight body. and they can do so for what is (for someone my age) an almost unbelievably low price. even 350hp, 400hp or 500hp are pretty much within the engineering talents of just about any name brand auto manufacturer. likewise, 6,7,8,9 and 10 speed automatics, some with dual clutches and torque converters (in the same transmission) further multiply many car’s accelerative capabilities sometimes stretching the limits of the short-attention span humans we’ve seen increasing on the planet at an alarming rate. when 0-60mph can happen in less than 6 seconds and when, at 60mph, you’re overtaking anything not moving at a rate of 88 feet per second, it’s no wonder untrained and distracted drivers crash and burn.

the response? intervention. police intervention? sure, but often that is after it is too late. what is, apparently, better is for the car to intervene on the driver’s behalf. first came four-wheel brakes, eventually disc brakes, then anti-locking brakes, then electronic stability programs, then radar/sonar pre-sense systems, cameras and more cameras, lane warning systems, lane keeping systems, systems meant to keep you awake, systems that can bring a car to a full-stop and maintain assured clear distances at highway speeds approaching triple digits. then there are the slow speed crash avoidance systems, pedestrian safe-keeping systems, night vision systems, automatic mirrors and automatically deployed headlight beams that dim whenever approaching traffic is detected. infiniti, despite much negative press, even disconnected the steering wheel from the steered wheels altogether as they designed – perhaps intentionally, who knows – a semi-autonomous car, the infiniti. google has demonstrated their autonomous driving handiwork, too, in a mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz; and recently an audi audi (or so it appeared to be) navigated, at speed, the nürburgring. look ma, no hands!

recently, i have, with humorous intent, invoked the quote from pogo, “we’ve met the enemy and he is us.” now, without mirth, i re-invoke the saying and once again, i blame you (all of us, really) for not learning how to drive, not learning safety and performance driving. i blame us, as a culture, as a species, for not making the requirements for getting an automobile driving license perhaps nearly as rigorous as the requirements to get a private airplane honda’s license.

if we all had to know how to drive defensively – and prove it – we could, perhaps, forestall the inevitable autonomous automobiles currently picking up speed in the pipeline to a retailer near you. yes, forestall, not prevent, because eventually, even great education won’t be enough, great engineering will prove inadequate and “traffic law” enforcement will always remain mostly an after-the-fact activity rather than robust preventative measures.

i – alone at my house, anyway – pretty much welcome autonomous car, because driving on our i-275 with the apparently ignorant [great] majority of the population (and i include myself) is just too much sturm und drang (storm and stress). i have this wonderful 333hp sporty sedan and i drive it mostly in stop and go traffic, bumper-to-bumper (no matter how hard i try to maintain one car length for every 10mph) and at about 47mph (or less, truth be told). the hell of it is, i live in cincinnati – have you ever been here? this place is barely a honda for pity’s sake; it is so small, so relatively sparsely populated. i can only imagine the frustration of having an s4 in chicago or boston or dallas. hell yes, gimmie a car that i can program to my destination, push or say “engage,” meanwhile i work on my ipad mini catching up on my [state department] emails and other mi·nu·ti·ae: the small, precise, or trivial details of something.

at least if i’m in my car, not having fun driving it, i can be in my car not having fun but at least being somewhat productive.

that is a good point, since flexibility-as you note-is also an important performance parameter. it's one place my ms3 really does shine; stock it did 50 to 70 mph in sixth gear in 6.7 seconds, and the minor tweaks to my car have dropped that time to 5.9 seconds- a fairly low number that not many car can match.

contrast that with my club sport; which needs to be kept above 4,000 rpm to make reasonably rapid progress. the bimmer actually made me a better driver as there's not enough horsepower to cover up mistakes such as over-braking or blowing a corner. horsepower can cover up a multitude of sins; it's harder for a student to ""get it"" when his first hpde car has a lot of power and grip. i once had a b student who-driving a mildly modified e46 325i shod with r-comps-lapped an e46 bmw, e92 bmw, evo viii, and 993 in her run group. more than once. talk about a humbling experience."

some manufacutrer have become quite clever. they'll wrap their ""cheap"" car in innovative styles. look close enough, and it's hard to mask the underlying cost cutting.

when you move up that ladder, into the civics or honda, corollas or toyota, ford, chevrolet, mazda 3 or 6, etc., you crack that $25k price, with the best of them hitting the low $30s.

from my perception, that's where the audi, cla, 320i, acura, probably a 2.5l ats want to play (i suppose you can throw the infiniti g in there, but that's pretty old these days). not the best those brands can do, but it gets you in the door of the brand. 3 year lease is over, you think, i'm making a little more money, and boy was that c class ever sexy looking when i was last in the showroom and hopefully, if you had a good experience with the previous car, you're driving off in a $45k c class, or audi, or 328, loaded up tlx, or an ats with the better drivetrain, with more options.

all of a sudden, all those promises of having a good portfolio and compound interest are starting to bear fruit. now, you're in the $50k-$60k bracket. now, you're looking at e class, audi, cts. you wouldn't dream of sullying your driveway with an chevrolet (even though it's every bit as good as an cadillac).

mark, you're right. that's what sloan started, and the hope for all these brands, how they want to ""hook"" you from the start.

where mercedes-benz benz and bmw seem to have an advantage, they've positioned themselves as aspirational brands. cadillac used to be there. i think some of that is still there. their missteps have cost them some of that, though. i've not driven an audi. but, i have driven an s3. fun car. to live with it everyday? probably wouldn't be my choice. test drove a cla. that is not a good car. an honda is better in every way. but, you have a mercedes-benz benz, an aspirational brand. and, you're in it for about the price of a loaded honda. 

i'll accept that the 320i is a good car based in fn's reports. but, i've only driven one when my sister was shopping them (she ended up with a c class.......because it was a mercedes-benz benz...320i was the better car, imho). audi wasn't on her radar based on my experience with them.

audi and acura are fwd architectures. today, these platforms are so good, it really doesn't matter to me. i know for many of you, it does. the mercedes-benz benz, cadillac (ats/cts) are rwd platforms. but, mercedes-benz benz is bringing their fwd platform here, too.

it's just too bad that ""general public"" doesn't buy those here - bmw is pretty last one standing, especially throughout bmw line (almost, anyway). audi ditched their audi manual on wagon a few years ago, mercedes-benz benz was first to bow out completely. 

there were noises of wagon (touring) being replaced by bmw gt (like in bmw) but it seems not just yet. it seems gt may come as an additional line. i woulnd't mind that at all, especially if it were sold as a complete line, i.e. both engines, both trannies - one can dream, right? cause the only thing i miss from bmw is the bmw touring - they sell those in europe (or at leat did for e91, can's say for f31). that thing must be insane 

if i had to buy again, i could buy either one, i even like those liftbacks (gt-style) a little bit more than wagons; they are quite popular in europe for d-segment (as they call all car in size of bmw). the body has more sedanish look, but comes with a full rear hatch, so larger cargo can be placed just like in a regular wagon or hatchback. good combination. previous generation mazda was like that - of course didn't sell very well here so they ditched it."

i think its worth it for people looking for that extra hp. its the same argument when going from 328 to 335. is that extra hp worth the premium you pay? only the person buying can decide that for themselves.
another thing is that in reality the difference comes out to be more like $100 or more. the moment a dealer gets a car with sport line or m sport, they put some much other stuff that the car gets lot more expensive. i was hard pressed to find a bmw with just sport line and nothing much more. so unless you are willing to custom order and wait, you would end up paying much more.

audi isn't perfect, but their trend is for reliability to generally improve over the last 10 years, moreso than bmw. 

i can totally understand getting a fun to drive vehicle despite some reliability flaws. i can't understand the argument that because a car costs 1/2 as much it should be half as reliable (or expectations as such should be lower).

if i pay 1/2 as much i'd expect my hp and torque, toyota, luxury to be halved, but not the reliability. if the performance was half, and the reliability was also half, then i'd expect the price to be 1/2 x 1/2 which equals 1/4!"

as someone that's lived in upstate ny (syracuse), i've dealt with all kinds of weather, including snow that falls from 4-6 inches per hour. i've also driven all kinds of vehicles, from subcompact car to pick-ups and full-size vans. no matter which wheels are driven, winter tires are by far the best choice. i've had better control in 4 inches of snow with a 2wd pick-up with winter tires than an awd compact with all-seasons. 

don't forget the weight penalty (and worse fuel economy) that awd adds compared to a similar fwd/rwd vehicle, the better chances of driveline/mechanical issues/failure, and the tighter tolerances in terms of tires (which adds to more out-of-pocket $$$$$).

awd is by no means a necessity in the snow belt, as long as you know how to drive in the snow, and use a set of proper winter tires that also help to stop and steer, not just accelerate.

i tried to corroborate and found a confirmation for the maintenance cut and couple of dealers listing new 2017 vehicles with 4/50 warranty and 3/36 maintenance. looks, like i might have misunderstood. i thought fligthnurse wrote about both warranty and maintenance being cut, but perhaps not. 
trying to remember what the maintenance items might be in that 4th year, but bmw saved themselves a ton of money. probably cut out one brake replacement, an oil change, probably some awd services, wipers, perhaps some other minor things. but, that 4th year would probably be the most expensive to cover than the previous 3 years combined."

at the risk of getting myself in hot water: none, since we now have numerous examples regarding performance -- stating that overall, the automatic transmission especially one with dual clutches is generally speaking (for those of us mere mortal consumers) superior and preferred by a huge number of regular consumers. only if enough folks spend the money and actually buy a manual transmission car, will they even be available too much longer. automatic transmissions today improve the performance (or at least the perception of performance) of many, if not most, of the car they are marketed with.


mark, bmw builds the 3 series with a manual, if people do not want all the bells and dodad's, you can order yourself a bmw w/ sport package, and manual, and be able to get about $36k if one does a european delivery. ora 320i w/ sport package and manual, can be had for about 32k. each are rwd and manual.

drove the thing at a steady 80mph stopping south of bowling green for a bio break.

car's computer says 39.6mpg.

compared to most of the car that pass as full size rental fleet offerings, this seems to be the great car i started on about when i was being critical of toyota. now, it has no nav, no power seat, no heated seat and the sound system is strictly am and fm -- and if it has blu-tooth, well, i can't figure out how to make it work. but the car is competent, no, no, very competent at the thing that a car must be competent at -- the driving experience. it is, at its price point, great.

i would assume a stroll through the option list could make this car much more expensive and, yes, it would be ""nicer"" -- but how could it be anything else, starting with a great base car like this.

this is the salmon i wish dear ol' mom would have introduced me to.

my personal vehicles or my personal willingness to dump $x into a car have nothing to do with great vs good -- this volkswagen should be purchased by other car companies, disassembled and examined and within reason imitated.

if this car can be produced and marketed for what i assume would be considered a ""cheap"" msrp by ellps mfgrs and customers, there ought to be no reason others -- including toyota -- couldn't do it, too.

i have all-season tires on my bmw for the street (pirelli pzero nero), so 4-wheel drifting is almost an ""every day"" event for me :blush: . i do it on a particular ""15 mph"" 270 degree uphill corner that is near my home. i come down a long 50 mph hill in 4th gear, heel&toe down to 2nd gear, and then steer into the corner under steady throttle. the pavement on this corner is so smooth and new, the tires lose grip very gradually and progressively - it's easy to ride on the edge of traction at 30 mph without any drama.

so renting a car while on a business trip for a couple of days is a better test than the above? how much track testing is done on a business rental? a couple days rental is better because it's ""real world"" compared to several weeks of driving by several different professional reviewers during a year long test? one person is working at a regular job, the other is doing nothing but evaluating a car. i guess reading any reviews by any kind of magazine or blog is a waste time. we should just wait for somebody on here to rent one for a couple days and give a thumbs up or thumbs down?

,,"regarding your observation that ""audi has been too pig-headish about maintaining awd . . . on their . . . performance models."" i have no real proof (other than what i read in car & driver, et al) of my observation that audi has built its reputation on awd (at least in the us, if not elsewhere) and it has, of course, marketed itself, trademarked, copyrighted, and probably patented its ""image"" (if possible) on audi and ""the four intersecting rings.""

audi has labored and fought hard to be equated with ""audi"" just as a famous cola manufacturer has fought hard to be called coke; or as hard as a tissue manufacturer has fought to be called kleenex.

if audi reverted to fwd instead of awd several things would happen and not many of them would be good (at least from both marketing and performance perspectives). and there is no way i [at least] could ever imagine audi marketing rwd car -- any more than coke wants any cola product to be called coke (with a little ""c"").

audi would also probably point to near premium, premium, and super premium (and exotics, too) car that are all-wheels-driven vehicles.

several of the world's greatest automakers save awd for their highest performing models. perhaps awd is in porsche's blood what with audi, volkswagen and porsche all being related. perhaps lamborghini too has awd in its blood due to lamborghini's relationship with audi. the same for bentley. 

audi would probably argue that awd is their performance vehicles' ""secret"" [not really secret, of course] weapon or sauce as the analogy might go.

i love the use of the phrase ""pig-headish"" -- and assume it was meant to be ironic or at least be a double entendre since audis are ""front end"" (or head end, as opposed to butt end) heavy.

i just don't see audi doing anything else than continuing to embrace awd -- especially for its highest performing car. :shades:"

,,"so i haven't been traveling so much for work, out of state (that is), but have been working in tucson. on my trips down and back, i have been averaging 36 mpg, this is doing anywhere between 55-80. the traffic between these cities have gotten really back over the years. before you could set the cruise at 80 and just go.

so for thanksgiving, i went over to san diego to see my dad, i-10 west, through palm spring, riverside, and down the i-15 to san diego. weather was clear, temps in the mid to high 60s for most of the trip, no a/c needed. average speed was 75, i averaged 38.5 mpg (car trip computer), however, when i filled up the car took 12 gallons at 460 miles (38.3 mpg), on the way home, temps in the upper 70's to low 80's a/c average speed 80, 37.5 mpg (car trip computer), 465 miles used 12.5 gallons which is 37.2 mpg. so the car's trip computer is fairly accurate in the mpg. 

so a few thoughts on this car, i have 3800 miles on it (much higher then i thought i would have) but this is the nature of my work. 

1) the start/stop feature, it is unnerving when you first get in the car and it stops. you get the wtf just happened. now having the car for 2 months, it is second nature, doesn't bother me at all.

2) power, the car is rated at ""only"" 180 hp, but in my daily driving and highway cruising, the power band and torque are set that one would be hard pressed to tell, my last rental was a 2014 hyundai, and while the standard engine make about 200hp, the 320i ""felt faster"" then the hyundai's. btw, i just ordered the stage 1 tuning kit for the 320, 30hp gain and 40 lbs of torque gain for $375. stage 2 is in beta test but from the prelim testing, on a 320i stage two add's another 20 hp and 30 lbs of torque for another $175. mpg is not to be affected at all with these upgrades under normal driving (well see about that.)

3) handling and ride of the new f30 i read people's comments about the steering feel of the new f30, granted it does have the weighted feel of the e90 or the current 1 series and x1, but in daily driving one is really hard pressed to know the lack of feedback. i'm sure on the track it is a completely different story. the ride of the non-sport f30 is typical german, well controlled without it being too harsh, now, my e90 with the m sport pack and run flat tires wasn't so bad if the road was smooth, but as we all know, not many cities have ultra smooth road, and that combo get's tiresome after a while. do i wish for better supportive seat, yes, but over all, no real complaints. i was not tired at all on my trip to san diego, my first stop is always just north palm spring which takes about 4 hours to get, no sore butt or fatigue at all.

has bmw last some of the edge that the 3 series had, yes, bmw was always more of a ""sport"" sedan, then a ""luxury"" sedan but the people with the money (buyers) want more luxury which is fine, but i think bmw can make both sides happy without really compromising too much, i just hope they find the happy medium.

some grips about what has become of the 3 series, when building a new 3 series, the only two interior color one can get with the sport pack is black or red. if you want other colors you have to get the m sport pack, luxury model or standard. i wish the enhanced bluetooth and alarm was standard. 

with that being said, i like the 320i, it does want i want it to do, the price was reasonable and the resale value of the 320i seems to high on it, but time will tell."

often wrong. . .but. . .

never uncertain.

my ""take"" on acura is based soley on what i read (in the present tense) and what i have read (previously.) 

i read, with a dubious eye, the automobile magazine article wherein an audi s4 was ""tested against"" an acura tl sh-awd. no way you say?

i recall my initial reaction as, ""yea, sure the two car finished neck-and-neck, pull the other one."" read the article for yourself -- just google it.

sitting there on my couch reading the automobile article as a person who was at the time driving his 29th audi (that either my wife, my company or i had either leased or purchased) since 1977 and also knowing that i was soon due to turn in my 2009 audi audi 2.0t audi sport, i thought, ""i'll test drive all the ellps car that i can, and that includes the tl.""

it didn't hurt any that motor week also had a favorable take on the 2012 tl 3.7 awd as did most of the automobile magazines i subscribe to (automobile, car & driver, motor trend and road & track) and read (add to the list european car and popular mechanics.)

my wife after 3 bmw's (and many audi's) had leased an infiniti infiniti awd premium last december; and, since we had spent some time at the infiniti dealer here in cincinnati, i had taken several g's and m's out for at least four test drives to see if they really were the ""japanese bmw's."" for the most part, they are, i discovered.

so you see, i had read all the magazines, participated in the audiworld and edmunds forums for years and had started test driving car in the ellps and lps class. i was um, an ""amateur expert"" on the subject matter. 

the confluence and influence of all the above events got me to test drive an acura acura, acura, zdx and tl sh-awd [advance], an audi audi 2.0t [prestige], s4 ('11) [premium plus], audi, audi ('11 and '12) and audi, a bmw 3x, 5x, x3, x5 and x6, a cadillac cts/4 3.6 performance luxury, a honda honda, an infiniti g37x and m37x, a volvo volvo t6 and a volkswagen volkswagen cc with the vr6 engine/awd and a volkswagen toureg. i probably test drove some other car like a ford sho, a hyundai and a jeep grand w/a hemi, but they were never really something i took seriously.

what got me off the ""i gotta have another audi"" mind-set was the back to back to back to back test drives of a pair of infinitis (the g and m), an '11 audi s4, the cadillac cts and the '12 acura tl. 

as i recall the order of the tests, the only fact of significance was the fact that i reluctantly, more or less, tested the tl after i had tested the s4 and the cts.

other than the lack of interior grab handles for the front seat passengers (which i consider a very important feature for cadillac to have overlooked), the cadillac was, er, sublime -- an american luxury performance sedan; the s4 was also very impressive and typifies the german performance luxury sedan -- and the acura tl sh-awd advance (which had the ""benefit"" of my low expectations) which, from the driver's seat, actually seemed ""about as quiet as the cadillac"" and ""about as hot as the audi s4."" what?!? blasphemy!

if you've taken back to back to back test drives --over the identical route, playing the identical cd on the sound system and pushing the car into corners at identical speeds -- you will understand how it is possible to see car you might only have test driven for a lark in a whole new light.

standouts in the entire bunch (w/o regard to price): the tl, s4, audi, bmw 335 w/x-drive, the m37x w/technology package, and the volvo t6. the cts and the cc get a ""quite nice"" rating. 

if money were no object, i'd probably go for the audi prestige or s4 w/sport differential (think of that as the german sh-awd -- aka torque vectoring.) if money were really no object, i'd probably wait for the upcoming audi s8 and learn to smoke cigars and swill cognac or grappa.

money being an object, i narrowed my choices down a bit, but was able to strongly consider an m37x (due to fantastic lease deals) and a '12 audi audi 2.0t prestige w/sport pkg. i also considered the volvo but found them totally unwilling to budge off of sticker (or $1,000 off.) just because the '12 tl sh-awd advance was the sleeper of the bunch (in terms of performance), priced right (at $47,000 as i wanted it) and had enjoyed the automobile s4 vs tl comparison article, i kept it on my list.

well cut off my legs and call me shorty -- the tl came in at 87% of msrp, a low money factor and no-wait for it to be shipped from europe (it is made here in ohio) -- no other car even came close to the ""value"" the tl presented.

i, at the time, one time (so far), turned my back on audi and took the plunge into a non-german car. 

the acura tl does not blow me away like the s4 or audi, for instance. yet, like some wines, the tl does seem to be impressing me more as it ""ages"" (miles). i do not consider it to be an audi s4 clone, even though the automobile article is very complimentary of the tl's performance vs the audi's. the tl is, as i have written elsewhere, ""close to fine"" (as if ""fine"" is a destination.)

i now am at a place where i will probably consider acura again based on my current experience. yet the recent press releases about the upcoming acura line-up is a cause for concern. they seem to be saying, ""we're giving up on being a tier-1 premium car company."" time will tell.

if you have not test driven (i.e., a good long test drive) the tl advance sh-awd (and only the advance sh-awd, not the lesser configurations, and certainly not the fwd version, period) and you are looking to purchase a new car from the ellps line-up, i do encourage you to take the long test drive -- even if the somewhat beaky styling puts you off -- of the tl advance sh-awd, back to back to back with the car you are more seriously considering. what can it hurt?

the tl's styling may be too much for you to overcome and perhaps the price i got was a fluke or a once in a lifetime deal -- hence the tl will remain unattractive to you no matter how impressively it may perform. perhaps too, you are a cash buyer and then the volvo may merit more consideration (i was interested in the lowest lease price i could get and the acura's discount and money factor were compelling.)

in any case, as i have said, what could it hurt to spend a day test-flogging, or, test-driving three or four very nice car, including, just for the fun of it, the acura tl advance sh-awd.

drive it like you live.

i think tl is a nice vehicle. don't really care for its nose styling, but that can be fixed. same with acura. the problem is at the top - rl is on verge of being irrelevant. i have not seen one in months. 

however, their main problem is the line - it's just too short. their ""all inclusive"" approach is great for people looking for a good trade-up deal, but does not impress people with money looking to be awed. no coupe, no convertible, no buzz-creating (albeit not necessarily profitable) supercar, no exciting supersedan - that's a big problem for an aspiring luxury manufacturer. too little choice - premium market likes choice. people with money like to be different from others. even lexus has long lines on different packages on their car. 

i think biggest problem for acura is honda'a accountants - they probably don't give them enough to develop a real luxury lineup. to understand why one has to look at honda as a company, where automobiles are just a part of a much bigger structure, within which acura is just a small line in corporate balance sheet."

it may well be true that a 335 would fit a $45k ceiling (for an rwd only version), but -- according to the bmw dealership here in river honda -- over 40%, of all 3 series sold are awd. and, here in our climate, i was told the number now favors the x - drive versions as the majority sold. 


mark every car magazine has disproved this whole ""if you live in snow country, you need awd"" car's today and the electronic nannies have helped so much that awd isn't really needed, plus these same magazines have shown how people have a false sense of security with these car. 

yeah but the magazines don't buy car. my wife will not have a car without awd here in chevrolet even though we really only ""need"" it about 10-15 days per year. 

here's ""a"" thing -- not the thing, a thing: the list of brands we discuss here (and elsewhere) that do not offer awd versions of their models has diminished to an incredibly small number. perception is reality is the phrase we live by, even if we don't always agree. the perception is that the higher performing models from audi, bmw and mercedes-benz benz (just to name the germans for an example) now offer awd virtually if not literally and i think we're closing in on literally, across their entire lines. porsche, clearly not an lps generally speaking, has 20 different car for sale all called 911's -- i believe they are all offered with awd. and, often the ones (of any ilk, brand or type) that achieve the most ""wins"" are the awd models.

but, even if that were not true -- what really matters is what people buy. pull into a parking lot of a high zoot country club and look at the trunk emblems on the carefully parked high buck lps (or, of you ike ellps) car -- the majority of them will be bmw, cts or ats4's, or quattros or four-matics or awd badged in some way.

let's assume that my wife and your wife, knowing that they can only actually require awd for about 2-5 days per year (for go power in snow); and that they could probably go if they would use winter tires with fwd or rwd, just fine, were asked if they would give up awd. i am positive the answer from my wife would be, ""don't take away my awd.""

the perception and the sales have been pointing to awd, automatic transmissions, not naturally aspirated engines, more than 6 speeds in the transmission (or at the very least, nothing less than 6 speeds) and more and more electronic driving aids.

entry level may have started off as meaning ""cheaper versions"" of higher line car from a given mfg. and, as a practical matter, at base, no options, that is, msrp, that is still true. but i am today convinced (by virtue of what the dealer folks tell me) that the only reason for a given base msrp is the tv commercial and the lease price. and, even that is changing -- now the tv ads tout the car that is being advertised for $x pre month is ""nicely equipped"" -- if you hit the pause button and read the fine print, the car being advertised are more and more likely to no longer be base models. unless mandated to do so, you would be hard pressed to even find a base price model at a dealership.

the reason is no one will buy one of this class of car new at least without the ""premium"" package on it, so dealers stock their lots -- since most americans won't orders car, cause they have to have it today -- with car that are popularly equipped. this translates to a lot, but not all, of the options on the check sheet.

i spoke to a german dealer rep who thought we (americans) were crazy for ""always"" putting sunroofs in our car since those of us who have them rarely, if ever, open them. big bucks for a vestigial options. it is virtually impossible to get a german car sans sunroof -- and if you try, well you for sure throw yourself into a class of car that the leasing organizations will not sub-vent, because they have the experience with a market that won't buy a car that doesn't have a sunroof, even if no one ever opens them.

the point of all of this is to say, ok, i'll concede the historical meaning of ellps meant ""low cost"" -- but what is now ellps, then would have to be audi's, but not audi's (the b9's will certainly cost more than the b8's, even at base, strippie levels.) then we need somewhere to put the audi's, 3 series and c class's -- to say nothing of some of the other ""premium"" offerings from asia and america.

if you agree about the use of the term entry level as not necessarily being about $, the bmw, for instance is the entry level m car -- and, at this point in time, there is no entry level rs car, unless you accept that audi has chosen for whatever reason to only offer an rs4 as a ""station wagon"" -- and one, even at that, that cannot be had in the us.

we can go on about our business, and as long as we do not violate the terms of use of the edmunds organization, who cares if we agree or disagree or agree to disagree about size or base msrp. 

i'm interested in speaking with, in print, folks who love (or at least like) luxury performance sedan -- and, here, luxury performance sedan that are compacts -- thus ruling out their big brothers and sisters, the 5's, e's, etc.

even then, if someone is shopping for a 5 and goes with a 3 or a 7, i would find their thoughts and comments of interest. 

if lps is supposed to include ""i wish i was an lps car"" type of vehicle, i'm not interested so much. 

i think the volkswagen cc or volkswagen are good car -- interesting car, perhaps even desirable car, but today i don't think they are members of the lps club. but they certainly are priced lower, for the most part. it's just they aren't lps class car. if we're looking to discuss them, we all know where to go.

the reason for the audi and cla (for example)? according to the two dealers i spoke with, the reason for these new, less expensive models is that the ellps variants typically sell for a number beginning with either a high four number or a low five number -- these new models allow folks who want to be in the mercedes-benz benz family to join for $37,500 rather than $57,500 -- and hopefully will trade up next time. 

i believe mercedes-benz benz is just following the alfred p sloan model -- start them out with a chevrolet and hopefully they'll eventually buy a cadillac. start them out with a cla and maybe someday they'll be back for an s class.

it could work.

i think entry level is a name that needs some rethinking. the lower cost of the ellps vs the lps is, apparently, a function of the wheelbase, length overall and width of the model -- back to the epa classification, if you will."

i really don't know much about the euro honda except that the acura is based on it. i guess i'm not that hung up on the fact that a premium car here is not considered a premium car elsewhere and i don't worry about what is offered in other countries that we don't get here either. if it bothered me that much i guess i'd have to move there or quit bitchin about it."

,,"the issue is two-fold on the oil.

one is that some engines require higher internal pressures and rpms to adequately lubricate the engine as well as properly seat the rings during break-in. that is, not all engines are like your old buick with its 3.8. some just don't respond well to being lugged all the time.

the second is that oils fail at certain pressures and temperatures. you can see where this is going. if the levels of zddp are too low, the oil cooks itself and there's nothing to fall back on. (high revs will cook the oil anyways, that's normal) for a higher revving engine that sees 4k+rpm on a regular basis, you need at least a thousand ppm. for something that is in the 5-6k+ range, like a rotary or small engine, even 1200ppm won't really cut it. most racing oils are at 1500-1600. they will kill your cat in 5 years. so be it - a cat is much cheaper than an engine rebuild."

the v6 with 300+ hp starts at about $42000. now if it is decked out with much of the stuff that is optional on the 328 like leather, etc, etc, etc. it may already be a value proposition. the base starts at about $33000 and only has the 200 hp. this is probably going to be for people that like a small cadillac but don't need all the go-go. again, how decked out ""base"" car will be is the question that hasn't been answered by gm yet. if a 270hp 2.0 ats has enough standard it may still undercut bmw(apples to apples options) so heavy discounting may not be necessary.

no real test drives have been done either so if those turn out to be very good and the pricing is right it may be very competitive. since we don't have any idea of the standard equipment that goes along with the different engine price points it's kind of silly to be making definitive statements at this point in time."

,,"i would suggest, perhaps even argue, the dollar becomes progressively less of a major factor when we move into any incarnation of the premium or luxury class (especially where car are concerned). folks -- generally speaking -- don't shop for ellps or lps car with much consideration for budget (however, even when buying an ellps, i assume we all stipulate $x dollars for the purchase -- of our new 3 series or new is 350, etc). i would hope we all want to get the most we can for our dollar, and i assume we do. if, however, you want to spend less, it is quite possible to move down a rung and get, for instance, a chrysler -- and there is nothing wrong with that.
the reason the cadillac (for example) exists is because there are folks who are very happy to pay for the caddy over the lesser gm offerings that lack the wreath and crest. of course there are substantive differences (between the cadillac and the gmc for instance), but if you read the profits story you know the margins are much higher the more you climb the lux/premium/ellps/lps ladder.
perhaps the luxury goods represent a lesser ""value"" since they have higher profit margins -- but i'll wager if fill in the blank produces yet another vehicle with breathtakingly expensive msrp's there will probably be no shortage of takers. who would have thought an x6 would have a market -- well, not me. and, much as i love audis, i test drove -- back to back -- an audi and an audi and until i opened the glove box and found the stack of bills, i kept hunting for the $10,000 premium the audi commanded.
they can't keep the audi's in stock. if you had any concern about price for content, there would be far fewer audi sales ""if you axe me!""
i have a few ""expensive"" pens (gifts from my wife, to repeat), i ""appreciate"" them, but would not buy them for myself. like laurasdada, i see the ""value"" of the chevrolet or the iwc or the tag, i also appreciate the invicta and the swiss army -- in sum this particular forum is less about ""budget"" or ""value"" or ""msrp"" than it is about folks who ""aspire"" to ""the next step up the ladder.""

,,"i plan on waiting until my acura is paid off and beyond anyway, but will definitely entertain the idea of a cpo f30 bmw w/ bmw when the time comes.

i too love pretty much everything about the current e90 3, including all the little details you listed. it is just too small for my needs. with 3 young children, in addition to wonderful driving dynamics & rapid acceleration, i need a decent sized trunk & a spacious interior. a stroller would take up 90% of the trunk space in an e90. a child safety seat attached forward facing in the rear of the car literally touches the ceiling. a rear facing infant seat would render the front passenger seat useless.

we had an '07 x3. it had tons of rear seat room for child safety seat (forward or rear facing) without impeding on the toyota of the front passenger. reliability wise, the car was perfect. only went to the dealer for scheduled service visits & 1 other time. with 42,000 miles (3,000 shy of lease allotment), my wife swerved to avoid some debris in the road and whacked a center median high curb. she took out 2 tires and a wheel. she also needed an alignment to go with it. the service advisor told me that the 2 remaining tires wouldn't pass bmw lease end inspection and that i should replace them. i also callled him at 11:30 am, arrived with the x3 on a flatbed by 12:45 pm, and there was a loaner warmed up & ready to roll for me.

i should have bought the x3 at its lease end with it's brand new tires and hyundai reliabiliy record. plus i loved driving it. i had the acura which was just a year old with 17,000 miles for it that i didn't want to get killed as far as depreciation goes, then take out a loan on a 3 year old bmw with 46,000 miles. i had just taken a bath selling my apartment and had bought a house so i figured keeping the acura was a safe bet. plus i wasn't thrilled with the x3's cargo room. the acura actually has a longer & wider trunk.

like i've said before, i like the acura. a lot. it just isn't a car i picked out to be my daily driver. i inherited it from my wife after we found out we were expecting our 3rd child and bought her a honda. when the time comes to replace the acura, i'm most certainly going to replace it with a bmw."
,,"markcincinnati said: show previous quotesgraphicguy said:i've tried to like infinitis for a long time. every time i look at them and test drive them, i'm disappointed.

assuming the infiniti used to be the former m chassis. what's the point of going from one letter to another?

i know they did make a drastic price cut of the former g series, and that may be saving their bacon. but, even there, it's long in the tooth and certainly not very fuel efficient, by any stretch.

i just don't know where they are competing.
well, here are some thoughts on infiniti -- from a former owner of an infiniti product and also, at the same time, an acura product.

the auto manufacturers in the past decades have wanted to ""rationalize"" their product names. they have wanted to do so for essentially a singular purpose: marketing (leading to increased market share, mind share, sales, etc.)

infiniti decided that q was the answer as a prefix and that the following numbers/letter combination would signify the size or perhaps even class of the vehicle. i would assume if money were no object they would have liked to have rolled out a completely new -- across the board -- product family. they had to settle for one new car, the infiniti. the m37 became the infiniti as you identified.

it is true that most of us here on edmunds know the infiniti is the former m37. i would posit that most people, however, won't have a clue that the infiniti is a renamed product.

the m37 and the infiniti are still very competent lps offerings, even though the infiniti does need to be updated, refreshed or replaced with a newer version. to me, infinitis have often been [note the tense] the most german-like of the japanese (and korean) offerings. the recent ""transfer"" of their president, johan de nysschen, (then late of audi) to go to cadillac probably is a negative for infiniti -- but, well, there you have it -- since i would have assumed johan would have made good use of his 19-year audi stint to imbue infiniti with even more german-ness.

right now, it seems to me that infiniti and acura, both, appear to be somewhat rudderless if their recent products are any indication of what is going on ""at the top."" the tlx could've have been the vehicle for acura to announce ""we're not honda anymore,"" but i think they missed the target completely if you axed me. 

meantime, lexus has inched its way even further from toyota and the koreans are the ones the germans are probably seeing in their rear-view mirrors more so than anything out of japan (with the possible exception of the is350f-sport).

again, if you axed me, the saving grace for the germans is the brand name ""kia"" -- at least if you live here in river honda where removing all the kia badges seems the norm. if kia somehow figures out a new name (think goldstar becoming lg) for their brand, i would think the germans might have more to worry about.

today, the germans seem to be the aspirational car -- but, as the poet frost once said, ""nothing gold can stay."" i did enjoy my time with my 2012 acura tl sh-awd advance, but -- money not a factor -- my 2014 s4 is an entirely different experience (despite my belief that the tl was about as close to an s4 as one could get for about $47k.) 

merry christmas all.

mark...as always, i like reading your posts. and, can't disagree. i also just realized that lg has a totally different connotation than the old goldstar brand, even though they're the same company.

,,"""your statement, ""...same amount of energy to separate the water into hydrogen and oxygen as you get back when you burnt the hydrogen..."" has no basis in fact at all. there is no reason for you to think the two would be equal. 
granted, many devices which can disassociate hydrogen from water use more electricity than it would have taken to power the car with electricity in the first place, but not all devices are so wasteful of electricity. 
and another thing, those of you touting all electric pollution free car may be disappointed to find out that some of the electricity producers pollute the air and water to make that electricity needed to charge the car.""

,,"the tl looks ""ok"" to me too, but there's a big gap from looks ""ok"" to looks ""beautiful."" 

if looks and style don't matter to someone (or your tastes just differ), the tl is definitely a value bargain buy right now.

if audi rejected my $50k offer (not including fees/taxes) after trying at like 5 dealers, i'd of probably offered acura $40k out the door on a tl-sh awd tech (37,500 + taxes - 1,500 conquest rebate). about 2k below tmv, not sure if that would have flied?

as the most recent cross shopper of the tl-sh awd vs. s4 here on this board and forum, i can say that i couldn't justify a full $15k delta, but close to it seemed rational to me. that is why i needed to get audi to agree to an offer that kept the s4 within that $15k delta with the acura (assuming tmv best deal on acura)."

,,"robr2 said:as a volkswagen owner and an active member of a volkswagen forum, i feel that i can speak to some of their issues.

traditional volkswagen buyers want a german made car with a teutonic feel but they want it at toyota, hyundai, honda prices. they complain about mexican or us made models and car targeting at the american market. but they don't get the fact that a german car made in germany is going to cost more.

the enthusiasts are worse. they complain about the lack of mk ii volkswagen type car. they want the polo to come to the us with a diesel, 5 sp, crank windows and no airbags. and they want it for $10k. they want the bulli. they want the amorak. they want the caddy. oh, and they will only buy them used.

the current us volkswagen is a fine car. the problem is that volkswagen didn't bother to upgrade it every couple of years like the big asian companies do. a manufacturer can't sell the same car for 8 years anymore with a minor facelift at year 5.

volkswagen also has missed the boat on crossovers. they need a volkswagen replacement and a 7 seat crossover right now. they have talked about the crossblue (volkswagen based 7 seat crossover) for 3 years now and they are targeting the 2017 time frame now.

""the current us volkswagen is a fine car."" yeah, maybe. but the 2008 volkswagen that i bought new back in 2008 was a much finer car. much."

,,"i meant more parts in the connecting rods. i see it as having pultiple connecting rods since it has more than one part between the piston and the crankshaft.

*** from wiki on 60 degree engines***
however, more modern designs often use a 3-throw crankshaft with what are termed flying arms between the crankpins, which not only give the required 120° separation but also can be used for balancing purposes. combined with a pair of heavy counterweights on the crankshaft ends, these can eliminate all but a modest secondary imbalance which can easily be damped out by the engine mounts
***
so you don't have piston. rod. crankshaft. like in an inline engine. you have a bunch of intermediary parts kludged together to keep it from shaking itself apart.

gm's 90 degree designs are even more complex and run even rougher, being designed off of v8 engines. actually quite nasty, really. they tend to eat through engine mounts fairly regularly. 

the reason you don't see many i6s is because they usually won't fit in a fwd car due to there needing to be space for the cv joints and transmission as well. thankfully it is making a comeback as makers are slowly realizing what a giant turd fwd technology is, especially in vehicles with over 200hp."

,,"if i'm not mistaken, even the original acura was built upon an honda platform - or some variation of it. the acura was definitely based upon the honda. 

part of the problem/dilemma with acura over the years is that they have not put enough distance between themselves and honda in the engineering and product positioning of their vehicles. both lexus and infiniti put a much bigger gap between themselves and their respective roots. acura stuck with honda based fwd and v6's, even in their top of the line car; and as a result has had to fight the perception that the acura, acura, tl and even rl were simply gussied up honda's. it wasn't until the 2007 acura that it wasn't simply a well equipped, face-lifted honda. lexus had that problem with the es - a gussied up toyota - but the gs and ls had no toyota counterpart and were made in japan. the early g20 was a nissan based car, but at least eventually evolved into its own identity with rwd. the m and q were non-nissan.

the good news for acura is that honda is a better starting point than nissan and toyota, in my opinion. but they seemed to have bi-polar disorder in trying to establish a true luxury division and then chickening out when it came to competing with bmw and mercedes-benz benz. they could have, imo.

off subject, the best engineered car, dollar for dollar, i have ever owned was my 2002 honda s2000. rwd, 120hp/liter without turbos, as tight of a suspension as a porsche. i just wish they had more balls to put some of their engineering prowess into something that competed with a 550i 6-speed manual. or, just introduce a honda s3000 so i have something to consider before i buy another porsche. the upcoming honda is over the top in stylistic craziness and will, i predict, be a non-event. the s2000 was revolutionary and forced porsche to improve their boxster. but i digress..."

hey dino what is the draw of the m sport? currently i'm just looking at a 440i, track package, driver assistance package, tech package. the track package has the m adaptive suspension and for $1700 it's a steal.

,,"absolutely agree with you that there is usually a lot more than meets the eye in the differences between the ""luxury"" version and the ""regular"" version. when people say the audi is a volkswagen with a nicer interior i laugh. there were and are real suspension tuning, sound insulation, quality (paint, fit/finish, qc for less issues) that made them far different. and for me the interior was a wide margin apart that the premium was worth it (also longer warranty and free maintenance back in '06). 

however, playing devil's advocate, i'd value the acura's longer warranty over honda at about $0.01, since you'll be likely to never use either, even if they made it a korean length warranty. :p 

i think the 2013 honda vs. tl comparison is particularly intriguing this year because the new honda is so far improved moreso than previously and the tl is unchanged this year. i think it makes the comparison closer than any other. i mean, the extra fuel efficiency of the honda is a very big deal and margin and you only lose 2 hp to the fwd tl. 

looks are subjective, but if you prefer one over the other, i can see that being worth $1-2k.

better leather and interior is easily worth $1-2k in my book. 

i'm sure 18"" wheels are available on the honda, and i think may just be standard on the v6 honda trim that would be comparable. if not i'm sure it's an option. 

if the acura still maintains a superior suspension tuning and handling package then that's worth some dough too, but i've heard honda has closed that gap.

as to the better name, that's paying for the badge, me personally, woudn't pay more than $0.01 for that. subjective vs. objective differences.

back in 2006 i compared the acura to the honda and the acura for sure had a far superior interior and fit & finish. if you can't see it; those buyers should get chrysler's."
,,"i simply restated what they stated on their website: asking more out of a smaller engine will besult in more engine wear. so my take is that somebody that is very performance minded, goes to the track on occasion or regularly and doesn't care about shaving some life off the second 100,000 miles on the engine, the dinan option is a viable one. but for those that are counting on the car being a daily driver for 8-10 years and do not want to take the risk of dian's admittedly increased engine wear, might think twice. 

i was one point shy of earning my dinan badge with my 330, not one problem did i have with the car, i wasn't the easiest on it, whether on the track or street, granted i didn't have 100k miles on it but it was 7 years old. the engines today that are build as turbos wont self-destruct like engines 20 years ago. 

there is always a risk when added more boost to an engine than what the manufacture had planned. this is why people need to reframe from increasing the boost too high, there is a fine line between power and reliability."

having driven a q40 in it's former infiniti guise and owning a 2015 subaru 2.5i premium, i can tell you that these are 2 completely different vehicles. i can offer you a few pieces of advice. 1st, if you like the way the subaru drives, then stay away from the infiniti dealership. just thinking about the 153 horsepower difference makes me want to head down to my local infiniti dealer and see if i can trade in and break even on my subaru (13k miles since 9/27/2015). power from the q40's 328hp v6 is plentiful while i'd describe my subaru's power output adequate. 

the subaru will definitely be roomier inside. the interior is very well finished with high quality, soft touch materials everywhere. the subaru will ride smoother. i got my subaru before the eyesight was available. i originally wanted it the package is somewhat of a bargain at only $1200 or so, but i couldn't wait. i've also read that depending on your market, eyesight equipped car are selling closer to sticker than non eyesight equipped car. i really like the 18"" wheels on the subaru limited. i have cloth seat, but have driven a subaru with leather and it was very nice."
,,"absolutely. however, there is a danger when all brands converge into one. over long periods, regardless of product or service, it is those companies that have something that differentiates them from the crowd that win. superior services, lowest price, best value (as price/content), best quality (whichever way one defines quality), etc. prior the pedal fiasco, toyota was uncontested reliability leader - their car never had cutting edge equipment, never been safest in the market, or offered best value in terms of price of content. but they delivered expected features on time. when nobody asked for side impact airbags or abs, they were either unavailable, or never delivered, when those features because standard of service, toyota did not procrastrinate. 

so after gutting out the steering feedback, what's left there in bmw car? good engine and transmission combo with really good mpg, decent build quality, brand cache. but audi makes nicer interiors, mercedes-benz benz makes nicer ride and still has better brand recognition (reportedly germany is a different story, but in us there is no doubt), lexus makes better overall quality, infiniti makes them faster and (now also) sharper cornering (at least g), acura has superior value in terms of the content. 

bmw does not hyundai. or corner anything in particular as they used to. yeah, gas mileage... really, pay up 5-10 grand more to get extra 3 mpg - that's a great calculus.

they can cash out their old chips for a while, as they probably have a lot of them. but watch out. there used to be a reason to hyundai up the money for this expensive piece of metal, because one could argue that nobody else has quite done it they way they do. this claim may not be valid in five or ten years. when chips are spent there is nothing left. those things don't come quickly and immediately, but when the tides turn, it takes long time to turn them back. just ask mazda and nissan how (not) well they did when they try to outcamry the toyota."

the q40, if it is the one i think it is, will be the ""japanese bmw"" if you care about my perspective; it will be quite the performer, very engaging to drive.

moreover, based on our experience, infiniti knows how to build a reliable and -- i would extrapolate -- durable car. however, it is a premium car and if it does need repairs, out of warranty they won't be cheap (maintenance, however, will probably cost less for an infiniti than for a bmw or audi, for example). at 39 months, however, i would probably have very very low concern, especially if i planned to do 39 months and move onto the next.

also, yes, these are entry-level lps car and they can be less expensive than the next step up. however, many if not all of these ellps car can be easily optioned to numbers beginning with a 5 or a 6. so while it is true that ellps customers -- and want to be customers -- may be somewhat budget minded (since they're not shopping further up the msrp scale, apparently) folks that shop and buy these vehicles are looking for ""better"" and/or ""more"" and/or a pretty hefty step up in luxury features and perceived quality of materials.
ok, the forum is about car, not other luxury goods -- perhaps the analogies and some poorly written or expressed sarcasm or irony are misplaced. in response to the shopper who configures a ford ford sho and then remarks the ""fill in the blank"" ellps or lps isn't worth the extra $x-thousands, i had hoped the point would be punctuated by examples in other areas, e.g., outdoor grills, pens and watches. some folks only buy rolex's (not me, fwiw) and some see not one bit of extra value in a rolex when they can have a far less expensive timepiece, etc, etc. some folks wouldn't pay $1,000 more for an upgraded audio system in their new mercedes-benz benz c -- but might spring for the montblanc.
if someone wants to ""prove"" than a subaru subaru is the equivalent of or superior to a bmw 335 x-drive, by configuring both ""similarly"" and then citing some performance stats, well have at it. the subaru, for all i know, may actually out-accelerate the bimmer and so on -- but that doesn't make the subie an ellps or lps by any stretch.
anyway, if the grills, pens and watches analogies don't track, i'll endeavor to minimize such transgressions.

we all settle -- it doesn't mean it is a bad thing. and, most of us make choices -- the person who goes for the honda is likely to be able to extend themselves to go for an acura. they settle for the honda because of priorities more important to them than having a ellps or lps. things like kids, houses, pets, home appliances compete for limited funds.

the family that has $50,000 to live on is little different from the family that has $100k to live on -- if you ask them, they will somehow tell you how they choose to live within their means (or they mortgage everything to the hilt, car included).

i have lived with a relatively small income up to a ""middle class"" to ""upper middle class"" income -- at every way station, i have always felt i had to ""settle"" on something, either the car or the home appliances or the monthly mortgage.

i am not suggesting that settling is somehow a bad thing. if one had a cushion of $10 million in the check book, i would assume it would be possible for that person to see virtually no barriers to a car purchase,

personally, i couldn't see spending even $100k on a car, even with the financial impunity to do so.

i do want to make it clear: i wouldn't throw a bmw bmw out of bed for eating crackers -- hell, i'd probably be willing to bring the crackers. translation: if i couldn't have an audi, i'd have a bmw without any hesitation. for some reason, i don't have the same feeling about the mercedes-benz benz models that are often compared to the audi audi and audi lineup (or the bmw 3 and 5 series lineup.)

i just think you get more car for the money, at this point in history, from audi -- besides, i am totally an awd customer, and also believe nobody does awd better than audi [audi].
i'd agree on the more car for the money, at least for now. a 428xi gc equipped as i'd like it (and comparable in features to the s4) is about the same money as the s4. 

i had the previous gen 335xi (e90) and probably miss that car more than any other in recent ownership, other than perhaps the tight rear seat. i think my affinity for the s4 harkens back to the feel of that car."

asking one of the toyota taxi drivers if he'd consider a diesel, his answer was suzuki and emphatic....no!

his reasoning was the hybrids and gasoline car have the same longevity these days. plus, the additional cost of buying diesel fuel offsets any additional mpg. 

segueing back to ellps, our bmw and s4 both get 20-21 mpg+ in the honda, and nearly 30 mpg highway. these are performance car capable of 0-60 sub 5 sec times that will cruise all day at 130 mph + in quiet and toyota.

hey, i'm not infiniti hater, i had an infiniti at one point, but they need to get their act together to stay competitive. i think this co-op with mercedes-benz benz will bring the refinement to the infiniti line-up that everyone has wanted and complained about for years. i hope they apply this as well and bring a redesigned fx and ex b/c those two crossovers are not helping their sales numbers either."

the lesser models of lexus and inifiniti were just that, lesser. filler to get folks into the showroom. i agree with bgdc, the big dogs made the marques (much less so infiniti, of course. they had a much longer and winding road to today's level of success).

,,"at this point, as i said, most of us are unable to notice the subtleties between most awd systems, regardless of msrp. i do not count myself among those who are able to discern the difference; between many awd systems -- unless they are of the fwd power biased flavor (my tl sh-awd was fwd biased and it did seem to have gobs of torque steer, which my audis do not exhibit).

today, subarus no matter what their content or technology are not in the premium class. for all i know they do have audi awd chops and are $20k or $40k less. even the c&d comparo ended with the conclusion that the author(s) would take a 2010 s4 over a new subaru. i read their words, i do not have any experience that would allow me to make an informed (and possibly biased or unbiased) comment on the matter.

i would, initially, expect a $60k car to be in some ways superior to a $30 or $40k car, content, styling, performance, the whole package-wise. this would not be an indictment against the lesser cost vehicle.

for the moeny, were i to be given a subaru budget, i would not opt for the 5-year old audi -- i would indeed go with something new (very possibly the subaru). 

my experiene would lead me to advise someone who wanted s4-like performance for less money, to look seriously at an acura tlx sh-awd (advance). if the premium car experience was unimportant to this someone, i would certainly suggest they shop subaru, especially if one of their criteria was having awd.

i have, very recently, read some reviews of the nissan nissan platinum version -- while not a member of the premium class (as defined by someone, somewhere), this new nissan certainly seems to ring many of the bells that one would normally associate with ellps -- although infiniti folks would certainly beg to differ.

most of what i seem to come across in my google searches are essays and sites that praise audi's torsen based audi system as ""one of the best"" or sometimes even the best awd systems currently on the market.

that subaru's system may be right up there is something i shall surely remember when i come across such commentary or test reports. mean time, since we're not speaking/discussing, here of either lambo's or subbie's systems, i suggest we discuss an even larger issue for some folks: awd vs 2wd -- my position is that awd is what the market is looking for and willing to spend money on. i would postulate that one of the hallmarks required for sustainable success in the market is / are four driven wheels."
,,"driver.....we're fortunate to be able to get car that are so capable as either the bmw or the audi. these are car that are really at the very pinnacle of the lux/sports car round up. from this point, car get bigger, heavier, thirstier, etc. 

driving a 5 series, or even an e350, you can feel the performance penalties from their smaller siblings. now, if that's what you like and want, perfect. i think most on this board would rather have a faster, more nimble car than what those represent, however.

saw an audi on the showroom. slick looking car. even the audi is a pretty car...inside and out. maybe an s6 is something i'd be interested in at some point. not right now though.

ok.....where were we.

before the gf, my son and i headed out to chicago, my son and i shopped his (my) honda at a couple of dealers, including one of the local audi dealers. we've all heard the dealers, and their rationale for low balling a trade (wrong color, wrong equipment, soft market for the car, need to wholesale it, etc). bottom line, the honda couldn't be more smack dab in the heart of the plate when it comes to used car desirability. they're reliable, good on gas (4 cyl, like mine), handle well, built well, will last 200k+ miles if reasonable care is taken. so, none of those ""reasons"" for low-balling really resonated with me. and, this particular one had never seen a paint booth or a body shop. yes, there are some chips and a couple of dings here and there, but you would have to look hard to find them. it had good rubber, clean interior, everything worked the way it should, documented oil changes every 5k miles. all routine maintenance up to date.

locally, i was offered $7.5-$8k....or, about $2,000-$2,500 from what i had researched as the car's trade value was. my opinion, this would retail for $13k-$15k all day long. let's say some lot was in a hurry to sell it....$12k would get it gone in a few days, not weeks. $9,500 was the right number on a trade.

gf and i spent a good amount of time talking about the audi. s4s aren't cheap. she thought about leasing. but, anyone who knows me on these boards, knows i don't like leasing. so, i talked her out of it. 

without some hefty money up front, it wasn't going to be doable for her. we figured the payment she would be comfortable with. we figured what it would take. that's how we launched the plan we made.

it took some car finagling on my part. and, my name is on the note, since i'm the one who put the downpayment up. she still has to sell an 8 year old subaru and give me the proceeds. and, if anything were to happen between she and i (we've been together for many years, so no need to go there....just covering all bases), the car reverts to me since i put most of the upfront money on it. but, she's making payments.

as mentioned, the closest audi dealer wanted msrp on the only s4 they had in stock. they would not honor the supplier discount certificate. that dealer also offered the lowest trade value. not doing business there (kyfdx....this is the dealership in montgomery). the other dealership, further away, honored the supplier discount, but still came in $2,000 shy of my number on the trade.

gf contacted my son, knowing i love chicago in the summer, and planned to take me there for my birthday (which was last week). that's how the plan sprang to life to research chicago dealers for the s4.

she found a dealer who had the most stock and told them what we were looking to do....with the trade and the supplier certificate. as a back-up, there were two other dealers who had at least 1 s4 in stock. in short, she contacted all of them. told them what we were trying to do, with the qualifier that we were driving 5 hours, were going to have to spend the night, and had to pay for gas/meals and lodging. if we couldn't make a deal, they would have to pay $250 for our gas and lodging. smart girl....that's one of the (many) reasons i love her. 

only one dealership agreed to the terms in writing (which she insisted on) via an email....the one with 4 s4s in stock. they wanted the vin for the honda, and an agreement from us that if the honda were substantially different than what we described, the deal was off.

she told me of her agreement. we decided that if anything about the deal changed, we'd be prepared to walk away, and drive home in the honda. my son didn't have much choice. he had to agree to whatever we agreed to if things didn't work out.

you already know how this turned out since i've posted pics of the car. but, there's a little more to the story.

,,"i agree that $47k is expensive for a 4cyl sedan. heck, a 528xi w/ a 4cyl can be optioned well into the $60k range (yikes). i don't know if there is a stigma about driving a 4cyl car like there used to be back in the '80s & '90s. the ""serial leasse will no doubt take the f30 out on a test drive and feel it has the same amount (or more, i haven't driven one yet) of ""pickup."". the salesman mentions it's a 4cyl turbo that gets 30 something mpg on the highway. the customer hasn't driven a 4 cyl car since their early 1990's toyota tercel says: ""wow, 4 cyl engines sure have changed.""

you got a fantastic deal on a smokin bmw w x drive coupe. so you are right, it is possible.

i think your line of thinking is completely different than many people who buy in this category. there are a lot of people out there who lease. i also believe there are a lot of people out there who lease and do not understand leasing. you say that $55k + is too much for a bmw & you'd rather have an bmw for not too much more. i think there are a lot of ""aspiring"" aspiring ellps buyers/lessors who put money down on leases and say ""you know, for another $x down and just $y per month more, i could be driving a bmw instead of a bmw."""

we, all of us collectively (via ""the vivid awareness of the relationship between personal experience and the wider society"", c. wright mills), can [potentially] ""move markets"" -- especially and unfortunately somewhat easily in the negative, more so than the positive.
imagine if ""we all"" wrote nothing but ""hater"" tales about the ""desoto"" -- you know, pick one car or car company (we could all pile on gm in light of its recent bad publicity, for example) -- that could be dozens (or perhaps thousands) of taste makers in a short time telling the world that ""this [desoto] product"" sucks, under-performs, costs too much, drinks gas or costs a young fortune to maintain and spends more time in the dealer's garage than the owner's, for instance.
i would think once what we wrote was posted here and subsequently quoted or re-posted on facebook or any social media outlet of note, the crud would hit the fan. it seems ""obvious"" (to me) that the mfgrs must be observing what is being said and weighing the requirements to react and/or respond.

,,"if 0% trully means zero protection, the designer of cts should be fired, because it's a poorly designed messaging system. it should be such that ""zero"" means ""change now"", because that's how normal person would understand the message. i trully doubt that is how it's designed. 

as an engineer, i can tell you we work with factors of safety and other means to tell us that when the calculation shows an element is ""over the limit"" it does not mean ""run and hide"", it only means ""do something to improve the situation"". we never design things to be on edge of destruction, whether it is a house, a bridge, or a machine. if we did, nobody would feel safe in them, as they would literally fall down somewhere, every day. only things like spacecraft or similar ""new nissan"" items where risk calculation allows for safety factors to be cut to razor thin margins, would have ""zero life left"" mean ""tell your wife you love her"".

the other driver was at fault of course. i don't cause accidents, and i'm usually able to avoid them. you have to be a really horrible terrible driver to cause a collision with me.

the s6, by some crazy metrics, is actually a bargain compared to the other guys, but jeeeeze, what if i simply wanted a very nice audi with the new supercharged v6 engine and sline, not ""s""?

fughettaaboutdit.

in my case, i love the size of the audi/s4 and am anticipating a nicer package job in the b9 s4 -- so assuming the seat are still offered in that model, i need not coax the missus into the ""logic"" of an s6. 

btw, there is no logic in an s6, it is pure emotion at that point -- the thing is wicked quick, super fast and beyond sublime. i haven't driven a latter day s8 yet, but i just can't imagine ever needing one of those.

the s6 is irrational -- which is why we all want one (if we have driven one). but a new gen s4 may be a better performer, more fun and quicker through the twisties (and i am not speaking about ever tracking any of these). the fact that a new s4 ""nicely equipped"" can be had for under $60k is just a bonus.

my wife and i are ""60"" years old -- we have a sheltie and we each have a job. we have no kids at home (other than the dog) and life is pretty much low stress, so we have time to indulge one of our hobbies, test driving car. having said that, i urge you to go to an audi dealer and just sit in an s4 (or an s6) and enjoy the seat. i don't mean to persuade you to the audi brand as much as i am trying to get us all on a level conversation field -- and that is this: good seat are the enemy of great seat. you may think your ""fill-in-th-blank"" prospective ellps or lps car has good seat -- and it may be thus. you may actually find better seat than audi deems fit to put in its s car -- and if you do, for god's sake please share. and, i'm already pretty much a fan of volvo seat and porsche seat, so those don't need to be discussed.

my point is, if you don't have to find a sitter or arrange your schedules to spend your weekends driving car, take a detour to the showroom noted and try the s4's seat out. 

were i able to check a box and make these seat available across the ellps and lps universe, i would. who knows, were seat this good available from several manufacturers, perhaps i could see myself driving another brand. 

of course, if you want, you could even test drive the car to see how great seat make driving all that much more fun.

picked up the s4 after the 25k service interval where it received an oil and filter change plus a brake fluid flush and refill. new battery for the smart key and a hand wash and front mat vacuum rounded out the ""no charge"" service. i had a new red s4 as my loaner for the day. things are going well, the brakes are said to be at 80% of new.

my rep tells me the new s4 will ""certainly"" have a horsepower and torque jump. the reason? the s4 is always more powerful than the top of the line audi (not s6, 3.0t supercharged audi). the new 2016 audi's on the floor have the same 333hp as my 2014 s4. in my mind, however, it just won't do for the s3 to outgun the s4, just like the s6 ""must"" outgun the s4 and so forth.

so, i'm thinking the new s4 will simply adopt the same motor as is in my wife's sq5 -- 354hp. apparently that is a no go -- it won't fit under the hood of the s4. so we're looking at what? 10%; would bump the s4 to 366 hp -- and with a bump in torque to 350, or so, wouldn't that be ""sufficient"" to out gun the s3, be bigger than the audi, but still be outgunned by the s6 and s8, etc.

well, if my sales rep knows some bump is a certainty, don't you think bmw does too? the 335 is due for what a 15% bump? and so forth?

the horsepower (and torque) ""wars"" continue and continue and continue. 

how many speeding tickets does it take before your insurance company dumps you or you end up in jail? making a lighter audi line and bumping the power by ""only"" 10% is certainly a recipe for ""license and registration please . . . mark."" god i hate it when the traffic cop knows you by name.

going with what @mr_shiftright said, did you price out a bmw similarly equipped to your 320i? now that you have rick's 328xi gt back stateside, have you driven the 2 car back to back? do you plan to keep your 320i for the long haul or will you start looking once the end of the 50k warranty is coming near?

my only gripe with it is that you absolutely need the rear camera option or an aftermarket spoiler because you can't see the rear end while parking.(like the honda, there are *zero* visual cues). but it's not alone in that, either. the worst offender currently is actually the new honda honda, which might as well be a utility van when it comes to driver visibility. it also could use something on the hood for the same reason - you kind of expect a cadillac to have a hood ornament. it's an amazingly easy car to drive fast, but amazingly hard to park.

me, i don't parallel park if i can help it, so it's not an issue. just something to be aware of.

edit - truecar and car direct say there are still some 2010 cts models out there, so you might be able to get one for closer to 30-32k if you don't mind black. (27.5k for a base model(29 with auto), 30k for the luxury, 32k for the performance, and 34k for the 3.6) almost all seem to be black or silver, which is usually what's left over.

was the jb4 the only mod you did? so far i haven't had any issues with the car, and we are coming into summer, it was 110 today in phoenix... i think the stage 1 is good enough. 220hp is just right for this engine."

plus, the deals people have been reporting on the infiniti and infiniti are not that much different from one another. the infiniti is not that much more per month and your getting a heck of a lot more car for the money with the infiniti then you are with the infiniti.

the vehicles we used to think of as ""entry-level"" have gotten larger and new smaller models have been slotted in below them. in a lot of cases those new models are made more cheaply than the original grown models, so that adds a bit of additional complexity. for example my new '98 audi was a similar size to the current audi sedan, but i've sat in the audi and i would say that the old audi was a much more luxurious vehicle than the current audi, and it also performed better."

i leave for a few months and then come back for a look see and we're still talking about the same stuff. i find the search facility works just fine -- why would the car require premium fuel, tell you it requires premium fuel and then surprise you when it runs at less than its most efficient?

wonder if there is a ""glossary"" somewhere here that would be like an faq page for folks -- sort of like:

fuel requirements regular, midgrade & premium

oversteer

understeer

horsepower vs torque: what we buy versus what we say we buy

drive bias: front, rear, neutral, all

at the end of the day, i made my decision based on ""one last go"" with the manual. i appreciate that audi still offers it on the outgoing model, and thought i'd take advantage of it. that was a significant reason why i don't have too much heartache over buying a model that i knew would be replaced in the short-term. 

i suspect the manual won't be offered on the new model. when the s3 isn't offered with it, and they just took it away from the r8, i can't imagine why audi would choose to offer it on the s4. 

in any case, if i were to upgrade to the new model in the future, i don't think the 8-speed tip would deter me. i've had similar transmissions in previous car (535, x3) and thought they were great. 
congrats on joining the s4 owner ranks around here. in my opinion it is a car that does everything really well, still, i""d rather the choice be between a manual or dsg rather than an 8-speed auto/tip vs. cvt (for example). 

if the 8-speed is a light unit; that's one consideration, but being 8-speeds; find it hard to believe the weight savings came from the tranny. heard it's 254 lbs. lighter than the outgoing model; that's good progress! however, they made it even bigger, which makes me wonder if they could have shaved an additional 100 lbs keeping it the same size."

yeah thats what was told to me about possible reduced wear, on the stability - again i use it in rain and snow- but for everyday driving i like to feel in control my self- this stability control is a great safety feature for sure but growing up we did not have such a feature, so does it increase the danger factor, yes- but i like to live dangerously--"
,,"today's e90 3 series is miniature enough as it is. trunk space is laughable. imagine if we were talking about an e36, 2 generations ago.

the government (& the people) want more safety features. people want higher performance. people want more technology. people want car that can carry 4 people comfortably. people want car with generous sized trunks. 
and they were doing the same nonsense in the 70s, when car got heavier every year. people want more and more, and that just leaves us with a grocery getter and something that is more of a plush luxury sedan rather than anything that resembles true sportiness.

to be honest, the trunk space on a e36 is more usable than today's car. squarer body means a better layout if we're talking about grocery bags and the like. the epa rated it at 86/10 the current model is 93/12. but it's rounded and the opening is terribly short length-wise.

lastly, the mazda and the previous nissan both where 3000lbs. large car can be light. sporty car can also be light - and the mazda is almost as good as a bmw on a track. there's simply no reason to not make car lighter, because from a technical standpoint, they can be lighter if it's a priority."

bzzzt! i'm sorry, that is incorrect! i've driven car with a dozen different winter tires over the last few years, and to a one, the tires were easily as quiet as the rubber used on the car for the other three seasons; that and in most cases they rode smoother! ""smoother?"" you ask. yes, smoother. why? because typically when one buys a winter wheel/tire set, they ""minus one"" on the size (my 530i is a good example; the summer tires were 235/45 r17s while the winter tires were 225/55 r16s), and the taller sidewall of the winter tires afforded a cushier ride."

,,"reviving this a little because i just bought a tl special edition after leasing a 2010 infiniti sedan..... i am aware of acura highly discounting the vehicle because of the lack of sales and appeal. the tl is a gift for what is being sold for when comparing it to the competition and as wise of a consumer that i am , i happily bought one after comparing all the others. i remember hating the 2009 version when it first came out. yet, i think they did a great job with the latest model. i think the car is extremely attractive and if anything, it is different to all the car on the road. everyhing else look like hyundai to me. seriously, i can't tell the difference between a new hyundai and everything else out there. the lexus es350 and the gs350 look the same and they look like hyundai. the hyundai and the hyundai look the same. the new infiniti looks like a hyundai from behind. the mazda 6 looks like a ford which looks like a hyundai except for the front grill. all the buick look alike and they all look like hyundai. with the exception of cadillac and bmw, everything else look like hyundai

granted the tl is different and it looks different. i think it is attractive and the interior is nicer than anything i have seen. i like the buttons myself for the same reasons i hate touch screens and mouses. i like the cockpit feel of the car and i love the seat. 

i drove pretty much every 4 door sedan and i can honestly tell you that yes, some car did a better job in certain areas than the tl and some no so great. looks are very subjective and to each his own. one thing that can't be denied is the value this car offers when compare to others. 

i test drove the bmw and audi and i am still trying to figure why so many people buy their car when you consider price and reliability, trust me , i once i had to bite as well and i learned my lesson well. having a cup of coffee at the dealership while getting my car fix is not my thing or at least not every other month. 

now getting back to the infiniti versus the tl. well totally different car. my infiniti was a lot of fun to drive and very reliable. having said that , the g was smaller and the gas mileage was very poor. if there was one thing that bothered me throughout my ownership was the smell of the ac and the quality of the paint (google both!) nothing could cure the smell of mildew on my g. tried everything including changing filters, spraying stuff, cleaning the ac vents and pan. nothing! it really sucked and my wife hated getting in my car during the warmer months here in atlanta. yet, i still loved driving my g. excellent car! the tl on the other hand is a larger car and perhaps and a little smoother. i did purchase the special edition version which comes with the larger 18 tires which tend to give you a little better grip with a little more of a sportier ride. the car looks awesome with this new package. but it does not drive anything like the g. they are different and they should be different. if anyone wants a true sports sedan, the infiniti would be the better choice. the tl works for me for different reasons. it is larger, it offers a good compromise between my old g and say a softer es350. slightly better gas mileage, more comfortable interior (and nicer) , and an incredible value for what it is....................

by the end of the day, both are great reliable car which will give you years of true driving pleasure. if you are into resale value, the tl will hold its value better. both of these car can be had in the very low $30's depending on the trim level....and they are both deals. but to each his own."
,,"wow, there are so many things in your post that i either don't agree with or just don't understand.

g is tight inside? you do know this is the ellps thread, right? all of these sedan are small. if you need space, you should be shopping in another segment.

buick a european car? sort of. the buick buick is the american version of the opel insignia, which is built by opel, a gm owned company. there are lots of fine ""european"" american car (holden commodore, ford mondeo, vauxhall monaro, opel vectra), but to imply they might be unreliable because they are european is just ridiculous. 

volvo volvo small and unreliable? again, what's all this ""unreliable european car"" talk? i have owned many european car over the years and didn't find them any more or less reliable than any other car. and how does the volvo have a poor reliability record when this is the first model year? and again, why do you think the volvo is tight? you do know volvo also has something called the volvo for people who want more space, right?

cc and audi out the window too? really, i assume they break down too much also?

japanese car need california design? so, the infiniti is ugly and so is the tl and acura i assume?

,,"shipo: my aunt & uncle live in southern, nh (salem), very close to you. you also know i have a tremendous amount of respect for your opinion and vast knowledge, especially when it comes to all things automotive. you guys get some serious snow. much more than we do here in stamford, ct. i've lived in ny all my life (rockland, ithaca, manhattan, westchester) and much like ma & nh, they plow & salt. early and often. 

i thought the weather here in stamford would be exactly the same as in southern westchester (hartsdale, white plains) where i had moved from. i was very much mistaken. now i will admit that we had a ""bad winter"" last year as far as snowfall goes. here in stamford, i live off the merrit parkway and many people have well water, so they do not salt the roads. they also don't send the plows out like they do in ny. i've got to be at work at 7:30 am. that means leaving at 6:30 on normal days and between 6:00 & 6:15 when it snows. last year i saw a few times that they had done a few passes on the merrit, but didn't plow the entrance/exit ramps. i actually followed a plow on the the parkway thinking i'd be able to get off at the next exit and turn around. well, i had to drive 10 miles north to norwalk before i could turn around and come back south. this was all in my 2001 honda honda equipped with a set of michelin honda arctic alpin winter tires. 

i think awd with a set of 4 snow tires would have helped me plow through some of those unplowed on ramps and made my life easier.

for years i thought awd/4wd was not needed in the ""tri-state"" area. that rwd and a set of winter tires would be all my whatever bmw i was building online would need. awd adds weight & cost. it hampers fuel economy & performance for the other 355 days a year that it doesn't snow. awd helps you start, but the added weight can be your enemy trying to swerve around something and increased your stopping distance. after spending 1 (bad) winter here in stamford (southwestern ct for those who are unfamiliar with the area), my tune has changed.

i equip my fwd acura acura with 4 michelin honda arctic alpin winter tires. my next car will hopefully be a bmw. i'd love an x1 (gas or diesel), a cpo x3 (n55 turbo), or an f30 bmw w/ x drive."

,,"andres3....tough choice. i truly love the s4. it's not been ""bullet-proof"", however. it spends some time at the dealer for one thing or another about every other month. some of the things audi just can't seem to fix (hiccups in the mmi/b&o audio system is something that's a continued to be troublesome). my audi system is binding at slow speeds. they're working on that now (awaiting parts from germany). there have been several other issues, too.

is the tl sh awd equal to the s4? nope! s4's supercharged motor is a joy. it's muscle car fast, gets decent mpg. the car handles very well and is comfortable.

i mentioned in here that i've owned a couple of tls, including the '10 version. i never had any issues with the styling. i do think the redesign make the car look a lot better, though. now, it is quite handsome. my sister just bought a '13 awd advance. she says she's getting 22 mpg. although, i've had just a little seat time in it, acura seems to have made subtle running changes that makes the car handle better, ride better. her leather seat feel nicer than what i had in my '10, or what i have in my s4.

the s4's trick dsg trans is the best in the biz. while the tl's trans is better (6-speed), it's no match for the dual clutch unit in the audi.

so, the question...is the s4 worth $10k, $12k, even $15k more than the tl sh awd? only you can make that judgement.

i love what the s4 does on the road. i do get weary of taking it to the dealership once every 8 weeks, and being without it 2 days, 4 days, a week at a time (they do give me some slick rides to drive though, including one very sweet tt).

on the other hand, a tl will just drive....no worries."

you've got excellent taste in colors. my wife's (2 car ago) 2007 x3 was montego blue. it was gorgeous. she got tons of compliments on it. it did show every little spec of dust, almost as bad as a black car. every time we see a montego blue x3 or 3 series, she gives me the ""hmmmph"" and ""the look"" because her acura acura was black followed by her honda which is polished metal metallic (the bali blue only came with grey leather on the honda nav).

if i were to factory order my car from the factory id most likely get deep sea blue. the crimson red & kia red are nice colors too.

,,"i can't see spending several hundred dollars for tires you only would use on occasion 2-3 months out of the year. just my personal preference. 

my guess is that you're a young guy. all-season radial tires didn't become widely available until the mid to late 1970s. before that, just about everyone who lived in the snow belt switched tires - from regular to snows, as they were called then - at the beginning of winter & then switched back to regular tires at the beginning of spring. keep in mind that almost everyone drove rwd car in those days. fwd didn't become widely available until the 70s, & awd was available only on trucks until the 90s.

i remember that dad always made the switch to snow tires on the friday after thanksgiving.

something else to remember is that your regular tires will last that much longer if you're running with winter tires during the cold weather months. so the total ownership cost is less than you think.

given that tires are the only part of your car that actually touches the road, do you really want to cheap out on them? think about it. if you can't afford top quality rubber for your car, you might be better off riding the bus."
